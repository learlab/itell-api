These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep.\nThink about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.\nIf you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following:\n- Does everyone require food to eat?\n- Does everyone need a decent place to live?\n- Does everyone have access to healthcare?\nIn every country in the world, there are people who live without such critical goods and services at least partly because of scarcity. Let's delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.\nFigure 1.2 Scarcity of Resources.

A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes. The FRED website includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time.\nThe Problem of Scarcity\nThink about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?\nEvery society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn't enough money in the budget to do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?\nOne option is that we could each produce everything we each consume. Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and \u201ctrade\u201d for the rest of what we want. So why don\u2019t we do that?\nMost of us do not know how to do all\u2014or any\u2014of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to because of something called the division and specialization of labor, a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith in his book, The Wealth of Nations.\nLearn with Videos\n  \n  \n    \n      How 10 Western Cities Are Dealing with Water Scarcity and Drought\n      \n      Read More\n    \n  \nThe Division of and Specialization of Labor\nFigure 1.3 Adam Smith Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\nThe formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723\u20131790) published his famous book The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of labor, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.\nTo illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people performed\u2014all for a pin, believe it or not\nFigure 1.4 Division of Labor Workers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor. (Credit: Nina Hale/Flickr Creative Commons)\nModern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills\u2014not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.\nWhy the Division of Labor Increases Production\nIn Smith's observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? He offered three reasons:\n  \n    \n      \n        1. Workers specialize in particular tasks where they have an advantage.\n      \n    \n    \n      Specialization in a particular task allows workers to focus on the\n      parts of the production process where they have an advantage. People have\n      different skills, talents, and interests which inform their educational\n      choices, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. Only those\n      with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some\n      goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a\n      wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist\n      hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. Whatever the reason, if people\n      specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more\n      effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they\n      are good at and some of which they are not.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        2. Workers who specialize work faster and produce higher\n        quality.\n      \n    \n    \n      Workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more\n      quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers,\n      including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair,\n      and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often\n      know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work\n      faster and better. A similar pattern often exists within businesses that\n      focus on one or a few products -- sometimes called the \u201ccore competency\u201d.\n      Such businesses are often said to be more successful than firms that try\n      to make a wide range of products.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n       3. Businesses take advantage of \"economies of scale\".\n    \n    \n      Specialization allows businesses to take advantage of\n      economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level\n      of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual\n      unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year,\n      each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory\n      produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with\n      huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average\n      cost of production per car will be lower.\n    \n  \nThe ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn\nto do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society\nas a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce\nall of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has\nbeen a force against the problem of scarcity.\nTrade and Markets\nSpecialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.\nYou do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music\u2014you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket\u2014you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car\u2014you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.\nLearn with Videos\nWhy Study Economics?\n  \n  \n    \n      The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate how decisions are made in a variety of personal, business, and societal situations.\n    \n  \nNow that you have an overview on what economics studies, let's quickly discuss why\nyou are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize,\nalthough there are plenty of important concepts to learn. Instead, think of economics\nas a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly, economics\nprovides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the economics \u201cbug\u201d has not bitten\nyou yet, there are other reasons why you should study economics.\n- Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.\n- It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d what were the issues? Did you know?\n- A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer's argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["scarcity", "resources", "individual decisions", "family decisions", "business decisions", "societal decisions", "labor", "fried", "data", "government agencies", "social data", "st london federal reserve", "scarcity", "food", "shelter", "transportation", "healthcare", "entertainment", "income", "water scarcity", "drought", "urban areas", "division of and specialization of labour", "adams", "discrete tasks", "formal study", "division of labour", "pin factories", "small business", "pinmaking", "specialization", "production", "specialization", "pay", "electronics", "sound systems", "music", "artificial fibers", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "economic studies", "societal situations", "economic issues", "common sense", "politics", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "01-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Describe microeconomics\n    Describe macroeconomics\n    Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy\n  \nEconomics is concerned with the well-being of all people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers' skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.\nIt should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.\n  \n    Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses.\n    Microeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports.\n  \nTo understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance.\nInsights about particular plants and animals help researchers to understand the overall food chain, while insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.\nWhether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the macroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual households and businesses make.\nMicroeconomics\nMicroeconomics focuses on specific parts of the economy.\nEconomists might ask the following questions about consumer behavior:\n- What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets?\n- What combination of goods and services will best fit their wants and needs, given the budget they have to spend?\n- How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time?\n- How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?\nEconomists might also ask the following questions about firms and industries:\n- What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell?\n- What determines the prices a firm will charge?\n- What determines how a firm will produce its products?\n- What determines how many workers it will hire?\n- How will a firm finance its business?\n- When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close?\nIn the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.\nMacroeconomics\nMacroeconomics considers the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation.\nEconomists might ask the following questions on overall economic policy:\n- What determines the level of economic activity in a society?\n- What determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces?\n- What determines how many jobs are available in an economy?\n- What determines a nation\u2019s standard of living?\n- What causes the economy to speed up or slow down?\n- What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay them off?\n- What causes the economy to grow over the long term?\nWe can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals:\n1. Growth in the standard of living\n2. Low unemployment\n3. Low inflation\nThe three items above are just some of the most important goals.\nThose goals are determined in part by a nation's macroeconomic policy. A nation's central bank conducts monetary policy, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United States, the Federal Reserve regulates these factors. A nation's legislative body determines fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxes. For the United States, Congress and the executive branch define fiscal policy through the federal budget. Some Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems they encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.\n  \n    monetary policy  -  policy that involves altering the level of interest rates, the availability of credit in the economy, and the extent of borrowing\n    fiscal policy  -  economic policies that involve government spending and taxes\n  \nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary policy", "fiscal policy", "high incomes", "low incomes", "environmental pollution", "consumer behavior", "budgeting", "firms", "industries", "prices", "firm", "employees", "macroeconomics", "overall economic policy", "economic activity", "federal budget", "bank lending", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "01-03": {"text": "How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Interpret a circular flow diagram\n    Explain the importance of economic theories and models\n    Describe goods and services markets and labor markets\n  \nTheory\nEconomists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation you are studying.\nModel\nSometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation. For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work. We use models to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.\n  \n    Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model\n    is a more applied or empirical representation.\n  \nThe Circular Flow Diagram\nA good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram (Figure 1.6). It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups\u2014households and firms\u2014that interact in two markets: the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees.\nFigure 1.6 The Circular Flow Diagram The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in the labor market.\n    Arrows \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d represent the two sides of the product market in which households demand products and firms supply them for payment.\n    Arrows \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d represent the two sides of the factor market in which firms demand labor to produce goods and services and households supply it for wages, salaries, and benefits.\nThis version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports).\nEconomists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others.\nLearn with Videos\n  Link It Up\n  \n    \u201cEconomics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a\n    technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct\n    conclusions.\u201d\n  \n \n  \n    \n    John Maynard Keynes (1883 - 1946), Economist\n  \n \nWatch the video below about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics:\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["economic issues", "circular flow diagram", "economic theories", "models", "goods", "services markets", "economic theories", "human behavior", "anthropologists", "biologists", "classicists", "psychologists", "model", "economists", "abstract representation", "empirical representation", "major office building", "physical model", "circular flow diagram", "economic model", "goods", "services market", "business firms", "vibrations", "economics", "teaching", "experiments", "management", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "01-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    \n      Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies\n    \n    Explain gross domestic product (GDP)\n    Assess the importance and effects of globalization\n  \nThink about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals.\n- Who organizes and coordinates this system?\n- Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants?\n- Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry?\n- Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible?\n- How does it all get done?\nThere are at least three ways that societies organize an economy: traditional economy, command economy, and market economy.\n  \n    Traditional economy is the oldest economic system and is used in parts of\n    Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their\n    economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition).\n    Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops\n    using traditional methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because\n    tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or\n    development.\n  \n  \n    Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort\n    is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt\n    was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building\n    pyramids for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord\n    provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In\n    return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord\u2019s bidding. In the\n    last century, communist governments like Cuba, North Korea, and the former\n    Soviet Union have emphasized command economies by centralizing economic\n    planning with the state. The government decides what goods and services will\n    be produced, what prices will be charged, what methods of production will be\n    used, and how much workers will receive for wages. In return, the government\n    provides necessities free like healthcare and education. \n    \n  \n  \n    Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic\n    decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A market is\n    an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services,\n    who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange is\n    a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a\n    market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based\n    on private enterprise: private individuals or groups of private individuals\n    own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses).\n    Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy,\n    by contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods\n    and services depends on what the demands are. A person\u2019s income is based on\n    his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something\n    that society values. The more society values the person\u2019s output, the higher\n    the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market\n    forces, not governments, determine economic outcomes. \n    \n  \nMost economies in the real world are mixed economies, meaning they combine elements of command, market, and even traditional systems. The U.S. economy is a market-oriented mixed economy, whereas many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions. China and Russia remain closer to being command economies, despite transitioning to a more market-oriented system over the past several decades.\nClear it up\nAlthough command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.8) is a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized.

The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides perspective on countries' economic freedom, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.\nClear it up\nWhat countries are considered economically free?\nWho is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index's category choices and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical discussion of economic freedom.\nThe 2016 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: Table 1.1 lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country, Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.\nThe assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a higher level of economic freedom around the world.\n  \n    \n      Most Economic Freedom\n      Least Economic Freedom\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1.

There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the \u201crules of the game\u201d in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations\u2014ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government's approval.\n  \n    \n      \n        The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a\n        black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead\n        involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market\n        freedom and government rules.\n      \n    \n  \nThe Rise of Globalization\nIn recent decades, economies have moved increasingly towards globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders\u2014in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.\nGlobalization has occurred for a number of reasons.\n- Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in Figure 1.9, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs.\n- Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information\u2014for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs.\n- Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.\nFigure 1.9 Globalization Cargo ships are one mode of transportation for shipping goods in the global economy.

Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.\nTable 1.2 indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.\nDespite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback against globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.\nHopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.\nLearn with Videos\nBring It Home\nDecisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age\nThe world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer's Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested.\nSome relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. This social media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.\nInformation helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send ten reporters to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources.

Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 2.2.\nFigure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso's Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier\nEach point on the budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso's budget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.\n- The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases.\n- If Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure shows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers).\n- Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).\nIf we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget amount.\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that's not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.\nThe Concept of Opportunity Cost\nEconomists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what one must give up to obtain what he or she desires. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative\u2014in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to understand another important concept\u2014slope\u2014that we further explain in the appendix The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics.\nWork It Out\n| Point | Quantity of Burgers (at $2) | Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents) |\n| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| A     | 5                           | 0                                     |\n| B     | 4                           | 4                                     |\n| C     | 3                           | 8                                     |\n| D     | 2                           | 12                                    |\n| E     | 1                           | 16                                    |\n| F     | 0                           | 20                                    |\nTable 2.1 points on Alphonso's budget constraint\nUnderstanding Budget Constraints\nCarousel improve needed\n  \n  \n    \n      View this website for an example of opportunity cost\u2014paying someone else to wait in line for you.\n    \n  \nIdentifying Opportunity Cost\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300, then $300 measures the amount of \u201cother consumption\u201d that he has forsaken. For practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to \u201cbuild team spirit.\u201d The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\nIn some cases, understanding the opportunity cost helps people alter their behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year\u2014250 days a year \u00d7 $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as \u201ca nice vacation\u201d instead of \u201c$5 a day,\u201d you might make different choices.\nLearn with Videos\nClear it up\nWhat is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed \u201csky marshals\u201d who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\nHowever, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million \u00d7 0.5 hours \u00d7 $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\nMarginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility\nThe budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis, which means examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You might think of marginal analysis as \u201cchange analysis,\u201d and it is used throughout economics.\nWe now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide. Utility is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes, the more utility one gets from it. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility\u2014perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor\u2019s appointment. However, later bus rides might provide much less utility\u2014they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring.\nIt is quite common for the first few units of any good to bring a higher level of utility to a person than later. Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, \u201cMy favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.\u201d Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: \u201cI enjoy leisure, so I\u2019ll never work.\u201d Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive.\nThe budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less. A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility exceeds the opportunity cost.\nFigure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso's Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier\nSuppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity cost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won\u2019t purchase more bus tickets once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can\u2019t (yet) say exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.\nSunk Costs\nIn the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.\nConsider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something\u2014anything\u2014else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.\nFor people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.\nFrom a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods\nThe budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["graph budget constraints", "opportunity sets", "opportunity costs", "budget constraint", "burgers", "bus tickets", "opportunity cost", "lost opportunity", "hamburg", "bus tickets", "video games", "work it out", "quantity of burgers", "bus Tickets", "50 cents", "ad", "outofpocket cost", "lost earnings", "lunch costs", "tuition", "books", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "dynamic programming", "gabor frames", "multiresolution hierarchy", "opportunity cost", "increased airport security measures", "terrorist plane hijackings", "marginal utility", "budget constraint framework", "total costs", "total benefits", "change analysis", "economics", "sunk costs", "budget constraint framework", "costs", "theater manager", "opportunity cost", "budget constraint diagram", "multiple budget constraints", "mathematical equations", "total spending", "opportunity cost", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "02-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs\n    \n      Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier\n    \n    \n      Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier and\n      the law of diminishing returns\n    \n    Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency\n    Define comparative advantage\n  \nJust as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society faces, using a model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.\nBecause society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education. The production possibilities frontier in Figure 2.3 illustrates this situation.\nFigure 2.3 A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier This production possibilities frontier shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to education.\nIf the society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources to produce education.\nIf it were to allocate all its resources to education, it could produce at point F, but it would not have any resources to produce healthcare.\nAlternatively, society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for an individual. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.\nMost importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso's budget constraint, the slope of the production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now you might be saying, \u201cHey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.\u201d If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nLearn with Videos\nClear It Up\nWhat's the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?\nThere are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier.\nThe first is the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two goods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various points on the PPF.\nThe second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources a hypothetical economy can have, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available.\nWhether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the \u201crise\u201d) over the horizontal distance (the \u201crun\u201d). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.\nThe Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns\nmissing fliping card\nLearn with Videos\nProductive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency\nThe study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.\nThe production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. Figure 2.4 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.\nFigure 2.4 Productive and Allocative Efficiency\n- Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not.\n- Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods being produced\u2014that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier\u2014represents the allocation that society most desires.\n  \n    Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology,\n    it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity\n    that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure 2.4,\n    including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves\n    from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and\n    education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production\n    possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it\n    is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination\n    of both goods. For example, point R is productively inefficient because it\n    is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the\n    horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1),\n    and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R\n    (H2 is great than H1). We can show the particular mix of goods and services\n    produced\u2014that is, the specific combination of selected healthcare and\n    education along the production possibilities frontier\u2014as a ray (line) from\n    the origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that have more\n    healthcare and less education would have a steeper ray, while those with\n    more education and less healthcare would have a flatter ray.\n  \n  \n    Allocative efficiency means that the particular combination of goods and\n    services on the production possibility curve that a society produces\n    represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what\n    a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a\n    discussion in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well\n    as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers\n    supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the\n    productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for\n    society as a whole.\n  \nWhy Society Must Choose\nIn Welcome to Economics\nEvery economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods:\n1. A society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of none).\n2. As resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.\nHowever, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present.\n- For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm.\n- At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want.\nHowever, for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.\nThe PPF and Comparative Advantage\nWhile every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country's PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.\nSuppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two countries in Figure 2.5.\nFigure 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane.\nmissing view\n  \n    When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another\n    country, we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good.\n    Comparative advantage is not the same as an absolute advantage, which is\n    when a country can produce more of a good.\n  \nIn our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount than the U.S., at point B.\nThe slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on International Trade you will learn that countries' differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which they have comparative advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["production possibilities frontier", "budget constraint", "social resources", "healthcare", "education", "allocative efficiency", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "budget constraint", "pf", "production possibilities frontier", "relative prices", "individual consumer", "diminishing returns", "ppf", "law of Diminishing returns", "fliping card shape", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "production possibilities frontier", "marketoriented economy", "democratic government", "inefficient machine", "long delays", "government", "market economy", "firms", "economic growth", "tradeoffs", "individual level", "comparative advantage", "us pf", "brazil", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "02-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making\n    Interpret a tradeoff diagram\n    Contrast normative statements and positive statements\n  \nIt is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let's consider these arguments in turn.\nFirst Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This\nThe economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate do not resemble neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.\nHowever, economics can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.\nThe scientist\u2019s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player has. Some might argue that a formula is therefore an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur. While a good player can still throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill without making a physics calculation, this does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.\nSimilarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide them with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on Consumer Choices.\nSecond Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way\nmissing view\nEconomics can sometimes portray people as self-interested. For critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral.\nInstead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others.\nEconomists offer several answers to these concerns.\nFirst, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false, but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They are just opinions based on one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worthy\u2014an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens\u2014an example of normative analysis.\nEven if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: \u201cHow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.\n  \n    positive statement  -  statement which describes the world as it is\n    normative statement - statement which describes how the world should be\n  \nSecond, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an  others might want to start their own business. People's freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.\nThird, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, named this property the invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:\nmissing view\nEvery individual\u2026generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention\u2026By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\nAdam Smith, The Wealth of Nations\nThe metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from self-interested individual actions.\nFourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.\nClear It Up\nmissing view\nWhen you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams.\nYour goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.\nIs a diagram by any other name the same?\nThis chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. Figure 2.6 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.\n  \n    \n      Scarcity\n    \n    \n        The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains\u2014just at a different level.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tradeoffs\n    \n    \n      The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint, we determine the tradeoff based on the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n        Economic Efficiency\n    \n    \n      The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual\u2019s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.\n    The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.\n    \n  \nFigure 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram\n- Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate.\n- Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.\nBring It Home\nChoices ... to What Degree?\nWhat have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue that people do not obtain a bachelor's or master's degree because they do not have the resources to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor's or a master's degree may not be available in their opportunity set.\nThe price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor's or a master's degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.\nFinally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices. An economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow money to attend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they graduate college.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["economic approach", "decisionmaking", "normative statements", "positive statements", "negative statements", "first objection", "decisionmaking", "budget constraint", "shopping mall", "us", "normative statements", "economic behavior", "moral instruction", "extended unemployment compensation", "great depression", "normality", "diagrams", "consumption budget constraint", "production possibilities frontier", "society", "scarcity", "masters degree", "opportunity cost", "college tuition", "room and board", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "03-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand\n    Identify a demand curve and a supply curve\n    Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply\n    Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity\n  \nLet's first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand and supply interact in a market.\nDemand for Goods and Services\nEconomists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants\u2014if you have no need or want for something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, from an economist's perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a homeless person probably has no effective demand for shelter.\nWhat a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units that consumers would purchase at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held constant.\n  \n    Law of Demand: Ceteris paribus (all else constant), an increase in\n    price of a product will decrease the quantity demanded of that product and a\n    decrease in price of a product will increase the quantity demanded of that\n    product.\n  \nWe can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as Table 3.1, a demand schedule. In this case we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country).\n| Price (per gallon) | Quantity Demanded (millions of gallons) |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |\n| $1.00              | 800                                     |\n| $1.20              | 700                                     |\n| $1.40              | 600                                     |\n| $1.60              | 550                                     |\n| $1.80              | 500                                     |\n| $2.00              | 460                                     |\n| $2.20              | 420                                     |\nTable 3.1 Price and Quantity Demanded of Gasoline\nA Demand Curve for Gasoline\nA demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure 3.2, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. A very important note to keep in mind: this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math: in this case the price determines the quantity, hence, the price is the independent variable and quantity is the dependent variable. An easy way to remember the axes assignment in economics is \"P's before Q's\".\nFigure 3.2 A Demand Curve for Gasoline\nDemand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves slope down from left to right and characterize the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\nClear It Up\nIs demand the same as quantity demanded?\nIn economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.\n   Demand \u2260 Quantity Demanded \n \nLearn with Videos\nSupply of Goods and Services\nWhen economists talk about supply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producers, or more generally sellers, are willing to supply at each price.\nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to produce and sell more gas, open more gas stations, or extend operating hours in already existing gas stations.\nAlternatively, a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied, because it disincentivizes new production. Economists call this relationship between price and quantity supplied the law of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.\n  \n    Law of Supply: Ceteris paribus (all else constant), an increase in\n    product price will increase the quantity supplied of that product and a\n    decrease in product price will decrease the quantity supplied of that\n    product.\n  \nClear It Up\nIs supply the same as quantity supplied?\nIn economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that we can illustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the curve.\n   Supply \u2260 Quantity Supplied \n \nA supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis.\nThe shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved. Nearly all supply curves, however, slope up from left to right and illustrate the law of supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases, all else constant.\nFigure 3.3 A Supply Curve for Gasoline\nA supply schedule is a table, like Table 3.2, that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons.\nThe supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve, i.e. the independent variable price is on the vertical axis and the dependent variable quantity is on the horizontal, just like for the demand curve.\n| Price (per gallon) | Quantity Supplied (millions of gallons) |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |\n| $1.00              | 500                                     |\n| $1.20              | 550                                     |\n| $1.40              | 600                                     |\n| $1.60              | 640                                     |\n| $1.80              | 680                                     |\n| $2.00              | 700                                     |\n| $2.20              | 720                                     |\nTable 3.2 Price and Supply of Gasoline\nLearn with Videos\nEquilibrium\u2014Where Demand and Supply Intersect\nBecause the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market \u2013 the equilibrium price and quantity of the product.\n| Price (per gallon) | Quantity demanded (millions of gallons) | Quantity supplied (millions of gallons) |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| $1.00              | 800                                     | 500                                     |\n| $1.20              | 700                                     | 550                                     |\n| $1.40          | 600                                 | 600                                 |\n| $1.60              | 550                                     | 640                                     |\n| $1.80              | 500                                     | 680                                     |\n| $2.00              | 460                                     | 700                                     |\n| $2.20              | 420                                     | 720                                     |\nTable 3.3 Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied\nFigure 3.4 Demand and Supply for Gasoline\n- The demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S) intersect at the equilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600.\n- The equilibrium is the only price where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied.\n- At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, so there is excess supply.\n- At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.\nRemember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in Figure 3.4, is called the equilibrium. The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree\u2014that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call this common quantity the equilibrium quantity. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.\nIn Figure 3.4, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.\n  \n    \n    The word \u201cequilibrium\u201d means \u201cbalance.\u201d If a market is at its equilibrium price\n    and quantity, then it has no reason to move away from that point. However, if\n    a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to move the market\n    toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n  \n \nImagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price\u2014that is, instead of $1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in Figure 3.4 illustrates this above equilibrium price and the drop in quantity demanded from 600 to 500.\nMoreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the higher price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this an excess supply or a surplus.\nWith a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making and selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n  \n    \n    Price Above Equilibrium:\n  \n \n  \n    \n    Quantity Supplied > Quantity Demanded = Excess Supply or Surplus\n  \n \nNow suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline producers\u2019 incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.20 in Figure 3.4 illustrates this below-equilibrium price.\nWhen the price is below equilibrium, there is excess demand, or a shortage\u2014that is, at the given price the quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price.\nAs a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level.

The result was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences demand and supply. For example:\n- How is demand for vegetarian food affected if health concerns cause more consumers to avoid eating meat?\n- How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover several new diamond mines?\n- What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or supply?\nBefore we answer these questions, we need to first understand a concept called ceteris paribus in greater detail.\nThe Ceteris Paribus Assumption\nA demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors, other than the product\u2019s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning \u201cother things being equal\". Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal.\nA demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.\nClear It Up\nWe typically apply ceteris paribus when we observe how changes in price affect supply or demand, but we can apply ceteris paribus more generally. In the real world, supply and demand depend on more factors than just price. For example, a producer\u2019s supply reflects the cost of producing a product and a consumer\u2019s demand depends on income. How can we analyze the effect on supply or demand if multiple factors are changing at the same time\u2014say price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors are held constant.\nFor example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy if the good is normal (and assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). After we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second because of the lower income.\nWhat Factors Affect Demand?\nWe defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand:\n1. Willingness to buy suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it.\n2. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation than students, because they have more income.\n3. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford.\n4. The size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.\n5. Finally, general or overall market expectations can affect product demand. If general sentiments within the economy appear to be optimistic, consumers may feel encouraged by sunny economic outlook and job security to spend more rather than less.\nPrices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.\nThese factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically?\nThe Ceteris Paribus Assumption\nA demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors, other than the product's price, are changing. Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning \u201cother things being equal.\u201d Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.\nHow Does Income Affect Demand?\nLet's use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand.\nIncreased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.\nThe original demand curve D0, like every demand curve, is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that no other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people, making cars more affordable.\nThe price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve shifts to the right to the new demand curve D1, indicating an increase in demand. Table 3.4 shows clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.\n  \n    \n    Income Increase -> Demand Increase: Shift to the Right\n  \n \n  \n    Income Decrease -> Demand Decrease: Shift to the Left\n  \n \n  \n    Price\n    Decrease to D2\n    Original Quantity Demanded D0\n    Increase to D1\n  \n  \n    $16,000\n    17.6 million\n    22.0 million\n    24.0 million\n  \n  \n    $18,000\n    16.0 million\n    20.0 million\n    22.0 million\n  \n  \n    $20,000\n    14.4 million\n    18.0 million\n    20.0 million\n  \n  \n    $22,000\n    13.6 million\n    17.0 million\n    19.0 million\n  \n  \n    $24,000\n    13.2 million\n    16.5 million\n    18.5 million\n  \n  \n    $26,000\n    12.8 million\n    16.0 million\n    18.0 million\n  \nTable 3.4 Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example\nNow, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D0 would shift left to D2. The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as a whole.\nIn the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for most goods and services. For some\u2014luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry\u2014the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is called a normal good. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an inferior good. In other words, when income increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.\nOther Factors That Shift Demand Curves\nIncome is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let's look at these factors.\n  \n    \n      \n        Changing Tastes or Preferences\n      \n    \n    \n        From 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Changes in the Composition of the Population\n    \n    \n      The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand (increase or shift to the right) for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Changes in the Prices of Related Goods\n    \n    \n      Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a product. A substitute is a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can show graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect.\n    \n        \n        Decrease in Price of Substitute -- Increase in Quantity Demanded of Substitute -- Decrease in Demand of Good\n        Increase in Price of Substitute -- Decrease in Quantity Demanded of Substitute -- Increase in Demand of Good\n        \n    \n        Other goods are complements for each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.\n    \n        \n        Decrease in Price of Complement -- Increase in Quantity Demanded of Complement --Increase in Demand of Good\n        Increase in Price of Complement -- Decrease in Quantity Demanded of Complement -- Decrease in Demand of Good\n        \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Changes in Expectations about Future Prices\n    \n    \n      While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.\n    \n  \nWork It Out\nmissing Carousels & (context below) here\nShift in Demand\nA shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.\nStep 1.\nDraw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P0). Identify the corresponding Q0. Figure 3.6.\nStep 2.\nSuppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to the new point with the new Q1. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q1. Figure 3.7 provides an example.\nStep 3.\nNow, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher.\nSumming Up Factors That Change Demand\nFigure 3.9 Factors That Shift Demand Curves\n(a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to D1.\n(b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.\nFigure 3.9 summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.\nLearn with Videos\nWhat Factors Affect Supply?\nIn thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or what we call inputs or factors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm's profits go up. When a firm's profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn.\nIn other words:\n- When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price for its output. We can show this by the supply curve shifting to the right (Figure 3.10: shift from S0 to S2).\n- Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left (Figure 3.10: shift from S0 to S1).\nTake, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.Alternatively, if the price of gasoline rises, the company may need to deliver fewer messages.\nWe can demonstrate the effects of production costs like these through a supply curve that shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, ceteris paribus. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price\nFigure 3.10 Shifts in Supply: A Car Example\nConsider the supply for cars, shown by curve S0 in Figure 3.10.\nPoint J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, ceteris paribus, the quantity supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S0 curve shows. We can show the same information in table form, as in Table 3.5.\nDecreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2. We can show the same information in table form, as in Table 3.5.\n  \n    Price\n    Decrease to S1\n    Original Quantity Supplied S0\n    Increase to S2\n  \n  \n    $16,000\n    10.5 million\n    12.0 million\n    13.2 million\n  \n  \n    $18,000\n    13.5 million\n    15.0 million\n    16.5 million\n  \n  \n    $20,000\n    16.5 million\n    18.0 million\n    19.8 million\n  \n  \n    $22,000\n    18.5 million\n    20.0 million\n    22.0 million\n  \n  \n    $24,000\n    19.5 million\n    21.0 million\n    23.1 million\n  \n  \n    $26,000\n    20.5 million\n    22.0 million\n    24.2 million\n  \nTable 3.5 Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example\nNow, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a lower quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S0 to S1, which indicates that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S1, which is labeled as point L.\nConversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from S0 to S2, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S2, which is labeled M.\nOther Factors That Affect Supply\nIn the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.\n  \n    \n      Changes in Weather or Other Natural Conditions\n    \n    \n        Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example, in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years.\n        A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Changing Technologies of Production\n    \n    \n      When a firm discovers a new technology that allows them to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice.\n      By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds\u2014and the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Changes in Government Policies\n    \n    \n    Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs, and higher costs decrease supply. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with regulations increases costs.\n    A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the firm\u2019s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm\u2019s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how this shift happens.\n    \n  \nWork It Out\nmissing Carousels & (context below) here\nIntroduction\nWe know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.\nStep 1\nDraw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q0). If you draw a vertical line up from Q0 to the supply curve, you will see the price at which firm is willing to supply.\nStep 2\nWhy did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts:\n1. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages.\n2. The second part is the firm\u2019s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that business.\n3. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm\u2019s supply curve, as Figure 3.12 above illustrates.\nStep 3\nNow, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by $0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as Figure 3.13 shows.\nStep 4\nShift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as Figure 3.14 illustrates.\nSummary\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Suspendisse at lorem ut elit placerat blandit.\nSumming Up Factors That Change Supply\nChanges in (1) the cost of inputs, (2) natural disasters, (3) new technologies, and (4) the impact of government decisions all affect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given price.\nFigure 3.15 Factors That Shift Supply Curves\n(a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to S1.\n(b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.\nBecause demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really \u201cumbrella\u201d concepts: demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We include factors other than price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of economic circumstances.\nLearn with Videos\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["supply shifts", "price", "vegetarian food", "health concerns", "diamond mines", "ceteris", "ceteris paribus", "demand curve", "supply curve", "quantity", "horizontal", "ceteris paribus", "price", "demand", "income", "price rises", "income falls", "demand", "drivingage children", "car insurance", "diapers", "baby formula", "ceteris paribus", "demand curve", "supply curve", "quantity", "horizontal", "demand", "income", "ceteris paribus assumption", "economically relevant factors", "car", "demand curve", "income", "tastes", "preferences", "prices", "related goods", "perperson consumption", "demand curve", "normal good", "pizza", "dotted horizontal line", "upward", "rightward shift", "demand curve shifts", "price", "service", "demand curve shift", "equilibrium price", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "supply", "firm", "profits", "revenues", "costs", "machinery", "inputs", "supply", "price", "production process", "natural conditions", "government policies", "wheat", "corn", "supply curve", "minimum price", "production cost increase", "vertical line up", "firms desired", "supply", "cost of inputs", "natural disasters", "new technologies", "government decisions", "cost", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "03-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step process\n    \n     Graph equilibrium price and quantity\n    \n      \n      Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand or supply\n      curve\n    \n    \n      \n      Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and quantity, based\n      on real-world examples\n    \n  \nLet's begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.\n  \n    \n      Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took\n      place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of\n      information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand\n      curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the supply curve;\n      the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply. From\n      this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.\n    \n    \n      Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects\n      demand or supply. In other words, does the event refer to something in the\n      list of demand factors or supply factors?\n    \n    \n      Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to\n      shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new demand or supply\n      curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease\n      the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?\n    \n    \n      Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original\n      equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and quantity.\n    \n  \nShift Only in Supply: Example\nGood Weather for Salmon Fishing\nSupposed that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather.\nHow did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? Table 3.6 provides the information to work the problem and Figure 3.16 illustrates the four-step approach, which we explain below.\nmissing Carousels\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original supply curve S0 to the new supply curve S1, which Figure 3.16 and Table 3.6 show.\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E1, the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to 550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve did not move.\nSummary\nIn short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.\n  \n    Price per Pound\n    Quantity Supplied in 2014\n    Quantity Supplied in 2015\n    Quantity Demanded\n  \n  \n    $2.00\n    80\n    400\n    840\n  \n  \n    $2.25\n    120\n    480\n    680\n  \n  \n    $2.50\n    160\n    550\n    550\n  \n  \n    $2.75\n    200\n    600\n    450\n  \n  \n    $3.00\n    230\n    640\n    350\n  \n  \n    $3.25\n    250\n    670\n    250\n  \n  \n    $3.50\n    270\n    700\n    200\n  \nTable 3.6 Salmon Fishing\nShift Only in Demand: Example\nmissing Carousels\nNewspapers and the Internet\nAccording to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. Most U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use their devices to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%.\nHow has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news?\nAccording to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? Figure 3.17 and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\nStep 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.\nStep 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.\nStep 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).\nSummary\nThe decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?\nCombined Shift in Supply & Demand: Example\nmissing Carousels\nThe decline in print news reading predates 2004.

What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?\nThe Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets\nIn the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.\nMoreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.\nA Combined Example\nThe U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? Figure 3.18 and the text below illustrate this using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\nFigure 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis \n(a) Higher labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price. (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.\nSince this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from \u201csnail mail\u201d to email and other digital messages.\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships.\nStep 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from S0 to S1.\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E0).\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. Note that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).\nStep 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.\nStep 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve for postal services to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E2) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).\nThe final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in Figure 3.19 above.\nFigure 3.19 Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased Supply\nEffect on Quantity\nBecause higher labor compensation of Postal Services raises the cost of production, equilibrium quantity decreases. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is also to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both supply and demand shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q3). This is easy to see graphically, since Q3 is to the left of Q0.\nEffect on Price\nThe overall effect on price is more complicated. Because higher labor compensation on Postal Services raises the cost of production, equilibrium price increases. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear.\nThis is not unusual. When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on the price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price.\nThe next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.\nClear It Up\n  What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements\n  along a demand or supply curve?\n  \n    \n    One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse\n    the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along a demand or supply\n    curve.\n  \n \nAs an example, consider a problem that asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an introductory economics class, might reason:\nFigure 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply Curve\n\u201cWell, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S1 to S2, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D0 to D1 on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E3.\u201d\nA shift in one curve never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.\nAt about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee\u2019s logic.\nHis first step is correct: a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D0), from E0 to E1.\nThe rest of Lee\u2019s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S1 to S2. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve.\nSimilarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D0 to D1. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.\nThink carefully about the timeline of events and the order of our four-step analysis:\n- What happens first, what happens next?\n- What is cause, what is effect?\nIf you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.\nIn the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not go straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities move in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are shifting toward one new equilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["supply", "equilibrium price", "quantity", "fourstep process", "graph equilibrium", "good weather", "salmon fishing", "bay bayousels", "weather conditions", "commercial salmon", "newspapers", "pew research center for people and the press", "digital sources", "smartphones", "print news reading", "radio news", "television news", "content assets", "core software platform", "interconnections", "speed of adjustment", "real markets", "rising incomes", "population", "gasoline prices", "us postal service", "costofliving increases", "digital message forms", "supply curve", "equilibrium price", "wheat", "price change", "demand curve shift", "dynamics", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "03-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors \n    Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism \n  \nTo this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no government intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when government does intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising too high or falling too low.\nLaws that governments enact to regulate prices are called price controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the \u201cceiling\u201d), while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a given level (the \u201cfloor\u201d). The following section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. And the section afterwards discusses price floors.\nPrice Ceilings\n  \n    \n    A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service.\n    A government imposes price ceilings in order to keep the price of some necessary\n    good or service affordable.\n  \n \nFor example, in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for price controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high that people could barely afford to buy water in the aftermath of the storm. In this particular case, the government did not impose a price ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.\nIn fact, in many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that requires landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best examples of rent control occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.\nRent control becomes a politically hot topic when the general level of rents begins to rise rapidly. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps local businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can cause a change (increase) in the demand for rental housing, as Figure 3.21 illustrates.\nThe original equilibrium (E0) lies at the intersection of supply curve S0 and demand curve D0, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in Table 3.7 shows and the shift from D0 to D1 on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E1, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.\nFigure 3.21 A Price Ceiling Example\u2014Rent Control\nSuppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500 for a typical apartment. In Figure 3.21, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there. At that price, the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units.\nIn other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was intended to help renters, there are fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).\n  \n    Price\n    Original Quantity Supplied\n    Original Quantity Demanded\n    New Quantity Demanded\n  \n  \n    $400\n    12,000\n    18,000\n    23,000\n  \n  \n    $500\n    15,000\n    15,000\n    19,000\n  \n  \n    $600\n    17,000\n    13,000\n    17,000\n  \n  \n    $700\n    19,000\n    11,000\n    15,000\n  \n  \n    $800\n    20,000\n    10,000\n    14,000\n  \nTable 3.7 Rent Control\nPrice ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing\u2014everything has an opportunity cost. Thus, if renters obtain \u201ccheaper\u201d housing than the market requires, they tend to also end up with lower quality housing.\nPrice ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.\nLearn with Videos\nPrice Floors\nA price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time should be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2019 was $7.25 per hour, although some states and localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual income for a single person of $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage.\nPrice floors are sometimes called \u201cprice supports,\u201d because they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.\nThe most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product, adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013, the European Union (EU) will spend about 60 billion euros per year, or 67 billion dollars per year (with the November 2016 exchange rate), or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for Europe's farmers from 2014 to 2020.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above P0 and prevents it from falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess supply, also called a surplus.\nIn the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0, with price P0 and quantity Q0. However, policies designed to maintain high prices for farmers\u2019 benefit, keep the price above what would have been the market equilibrium level \u2014 the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, a surplus exists.\nFigure 3.22 European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor Example\nEconomists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have offered numerous proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is either because the population views this as supporting the traditional rural way of life or because of auto-business lobbying power.\nLearn with Videos\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["price controls", "price ceilings", "price floors", "demand", "supply", "social adjustment mechanism", "rent control", "legal maximum price", "bottled water", "price controls", "demand curve", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "price floor", "minimum wage", "cost of living", "agricultural price supports", "excess supply", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "03-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus \n    Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient \n    Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism \n  \nThe familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.\nEfficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.\nConsumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus\nConsider a market for tablet computers, as Figure 3.23 shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left.\nFigure 3.23 Consumer and Producer Surplus\nThe somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which demonstrates that the equilibrium price was less than many consumers were willing to pay for the good. Consider point J. At point J, consumers were willing to purchase 20 million units of the good at the price of $90 or $10 higher than the equilibrium price of $80. Consumers who were willing to spend $90 on the good are able to enjoy the benefit of keeping $10 by paying only $80. Thus, the total area of shape F measures the size of the total consumer surplus at the equilibrium price of $80.\nSimilarly, the somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market, $80, was more than what many of the producers were willing to accept for their products, for example $45 (point K). For that price, firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Thus, all of the producers who were willing to supply the good at $45, were able to receive the difference between $80 and $45, or $35. The total area of shape G measures the size of the total producer surplus at the equilibrium price of $80.\nThis portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet. For example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expected to receive from it, despite being able to pay the equilibrium price of $80. They clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area labeled F\u2014that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.\nThe supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in Figure 3.23 illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, despite being able to charge the equilibrium price of $80. They clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller\u2019s actual cost is called producer surplus. In Figure 3.23, producer surplus is the area labeled G\u2014that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.\nThe sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus. In Figure 3.23 we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to generate greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.\nInefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings\nThe imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.\nFigure 3.24 Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings\n(a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X.\n(b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.\nImagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in Figure 3.24 (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.\nAs a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 3.24 (a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make.\nA second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.\nLearn with Videos\nThis analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to consumers\u2014which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy's social surplus.\nLearn with Videos\nDemand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism\nThe demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a price was like arguing \u201cwhether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.\u201d The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved.\nThe adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people\u2014call them the coffee addicts\u2014continue to drink coffee and pay the higher price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice them.\nThink for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and restaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the U.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets\u2014that is, demand and supply\u2014are the primary social mechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.\nLearn with Videos\nBring It Home\nWhy Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?\nOrganic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales increased from $1 billion in 1990 to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food products.\nWhy, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.\nIn addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.\nAs a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group's \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of fruits and vegetables, which test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the list has led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of sales.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["consumer surplus", "producer surplus", "social surplus", "price floors", "price ceilings", "demand", "consumer surplus", "producer surplus", "social surplus", "tablet computers", "equilibrium price", "inefficiency", "price Floors", "price ceiling", "consumer surplus", "producer surplus", "back pain", "price ceiling", "rent controls", "producer surplus", "farmers", "consumer surplus", "deadweight", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "demand", "supply", "equilibrium price", "quantity", "marketoriented economy", "brazil", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "organic food", "synthetic pesticides", "chemical fertilizers", "genetically modified seeds", "organic trade association", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "04-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n    Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market\n    \n      Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves of\n      the labor market\n    \n    \n      Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a living\n      wage\n    \n  \nMarkets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applied to labor markets means that a higher salary or wage \u2014 that is, a higher price in the labor market \u2014 leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salaryor wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.\n  \n  Labor Market\n    Law of Demand:  A higher salary or wage leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers and a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded.\n    Law of Supply:   A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.\n  \nEquilibrium in the Labor Market\nIn 2015, about 35,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes.\nFigure 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington\n- The demand curve (D) of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E).\n- The equilibrium salary is $70,000 and the equilibrium quantity is 34,000 nurses.\n- At an above-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied increases to 38,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 33,000. At this above-equilibrium salary, an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist.\n- At a below-equilibrium salary of $60,000, quantity supplied declines to 27,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 40,000 nurses.\n- At this below-equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.\n  \n    Annual Salary\n    Quantity Demanded\n    Quantity Supplied\n  \n  \n    $55,000\n    45,000\n    20,000\n  \n  \n    $60,000\n    40,000\n    27,000\n  \n  \n    $65,000\n    37,000\n    31,000\n  \n  \n    $70,000\n    34,000\n    34,000\n  \n  \n    $75,000\n    33,000\n    38,000\n  \n  \n    $80,000\n    32,000\n    41,000\n  \nTable 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington\nThe horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example we measure labor by number of workers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The vertical axis shows the price for nurses\u2019 labor\u2014that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this \u201cprice\u201d would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part of labor compensation, as high as 30%. In this example we measure the price of labor by salary on an annual basis, although in other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour.\nAs the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses\u2019 salaries may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.\nAs the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses\u2019 salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full- time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area.\n    \n        At equilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In Figure 4.2, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is $70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by focusing on the \u201caverage\u201d nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the submarkets.\n    \n    \n        When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at $75,000 per year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess supply in the labor market, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses' salary will move down toward equilibrium.\n        In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.\n    \nMovements Along Labor Demand Curve\nThe demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate, ceteris paribus. A change in salary or wage will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward (i.e. leftward) along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward (i.e. rightward) movement along the demand curve. Thus, the changes in quantity demanded are caused by changes in the single variable, the price for labor.\nShifts in Labor Demand\nA change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift those curves. However, other events like those we will outline in the next few paragraphs cause either the demand or the supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.\nShifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a \u201cderived demand.\u201d Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:\n- The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.\n- The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.\n- The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.\nAs the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers' production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. Table 4.2 shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.\n\nFactors That Can Shift Demand\n  \n    \n      Demand for Output / Good\n    \n    \n        When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Education and Training\n    \n    \n    Increasing Demand:\n    - A well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by employers.\n    - Increased levels of productivity within the workforce will cause the demand for labor to shift to the right or to increase.\n    Decreasing Demand:\n    - If the workforce is not well-trained or educated, employers will not hire from within that labor pool, since they will need to spend a significa*nt amount* of time and money training that workforce.\n    Demand for lesser-skilled workers will shift to the left.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Technology\n    \n    \n    Technology changes can act as either substitutes for or complements to labor:\n    - When technology acts as a substitute, it replaces the need for the number of workers an employer needs to hire. For example, word processing decreased the number of typists needed in the workplace. This shifted the demand curve for typists left.\n    - An increase in the availability of certain technologies may increase the demand for labor. Technology that acts as a complement to labor will increase the demand for certain types of labor, resulting in a rightward shift of the demand curve. For example, the increased use of word processing and other software has increased the demand for information technology professionals who can resolve software and hardware issues related to a firm\u2019s network.\n    Impact of technology on skills:\n    - More and better technology will increase demand for skilled workers who know how to use technology to enhance workplace productivity.\n    Yet, those workers who do not adapt to changes in technology will experience a decrease in demand.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Number of Companies\n    \n    \n    - An increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the right.\n    - A decrease in the number of companies producing a given product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Government Regulations\n    \n    \n    Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given wage.\n    - In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses.\n    - Less-trained healthcare workers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these workers will shift to the left.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Price and Availability of Other Inputs\n    \n    \n    Labor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a salesperson at a call center needs a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record sales.\n    - If prices of other inputs fall, production will become more profitable and suppliers will demand more labor to increase production. This will cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for labor.\n    - The opposite is also true. Higher prices for other inputs lower demand for labor.\n    \n  \n\n# Shifts in Labor Supply\nThe supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the quantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff between supplying labor into the market, switching to different labor market, or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The higher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. Below are some of the factors that will cause the supply to increase or decrease:\n\n# Factors That Can Shift Supply\n  \n    \n      Number of Workers\n    \n    \n        An increased number of workers will cause the supply curve to shift to the right. An increased number of workers can be due to several factors, such as immigration, increasing population, an aging population, and changing demographics. Policies that encourage immigration will increase the supply of labor, and vice versa. Population grows when birth rates exceed death rates. This eventually increases supply of labor when the former reach working age. An aging and therefore retiring population will decrease the supply of labor. Another example of changing demographics is more women working outside of the home, which increases the supply of labor.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Required Education\n    \n    \n    The more required education, the lower the supply. There is a lower supply of PhD mathematicians than of high school mathematics teachers; there is a lower supply of cardiologists than of primary care physicians; and there is a lower supply of physicians than of nurses.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Number of Companies\n    \n    \n    - An increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the right.\n    - A decrease in the number of companies producing a given product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Government Policies\n    \n    \n    Government policies can also affect the supply of labor for jobs. Alternatively, the government may support rules that set high qualifications for certain jobs: academic training, certificates or licenses, or experience. When these qualifications are made tougher, the number of qualified workers will decrease at any given wage. On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even reduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of working mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed workers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor supply effects.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Government Regulations\n    \n    \n    Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given wage.\n    - In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses.\n    - Less-trained healthcare workers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these workers will shift to the left.\n    \n  \n    \n    \n      Price and Availability of Other Inputs\n    \n    \n    Labor is not the only input into the production process.

Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in Demand and Supply) works in this way:\nStep 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new technologies? In Figure 4.3 (a) and Figure 4.3 (b), S0 is the original supply curve for labor and D0 is the original demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E0, occurs at the price W0 and the quantity Q0.\nFigure 4.3\nTechnology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply\n(a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.\nStep 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.\nStep 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D0 to D1. As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the right, from D0 to D1.\nStep 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a lower wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E0. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E0).\nThus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s, the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with comparable job experience, but by 2014, a college graduate earned about 66% more than an otherwise comparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy is due to improvements in technology.\n  \n  \n    \n      10 Technology Skills That Will No Longer Help You Get a JobRead\n      More\n    \n  \nPrice Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages\nIn contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the high incomes of top business executives.\nThe labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to increase the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a minimum wage, a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage, which they call a living wage. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is $14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. Thus the family income would be $14,500, which is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $24,250 in 2015.)\nSupporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.\n- The original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/ hour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E.\n- Imposing a wage floor at $12/hour leads to an excess supply of labor.\n- At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.\nFigure 4.4 illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law.\n- For simplicity, we assume that there is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at this wage.\n- However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs within the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market.\n- For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved. Table 4.4 shows the differences in supply and demand at different wages.\nFigure 4.4 A Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor\nThe original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/hour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E. Imposing a wage floor at $12/hour leads to an excess supply of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.\n  \n    Wage\n    Quantity Labor Demanded\n    Quantity Labor Supplied\n  \n  \n    $8/hr\n    1,900\n    500\n  \n  \n    $9/hr\n    1,500\n    900\n  \n  \n    $10/hr\n    1,200\n    1,200\n  \n  \n    $11/hr\n    900\n    1,400\n  \n  \n    $12/hr\n    700\n    1,600\n  \n  \n    $13/hr\n    500\n    1,800\n  \n  \n    $14/hr\n    400\n    1,900\n  \nTable 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor\nLearn with Videos\nThe Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor\nThe U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly below it.\nAbout 2% of American workers are actually paid at or below the minimum wage. In other words, the vast majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor. However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently below the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.\nEconomists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places\u2014although these studies are controversial.\nLet\u2019s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly below the equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage is nonbinding \u2014that is, the price floor is not determining the market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity of employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage.\nmissing view\nEven if the government increases minimum wage enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.\nThese insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the minimum wage increased dramatically\u2014say, if it doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have considered\u2014then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. As of 2017, many U.S. states are set to increase their minimum wage to $15 per hour. We will see what happens. The following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.\nClear It Up\nmissing view\nAlthough there is controversy over the numbers, let\u2019s say for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%.\nDoes this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy?\nNot necessarily.\nWhat's the harm in raising the minimum wage?\nBecause of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in terms of work hours.\nIf 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.\nAnother complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want people to work. Overall, this worker\u2019s income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.\nOf course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers (The Poverty and Economic Inequality chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["law of supply", "minimum wage", "higher salaryor wage", "lower quantity supplied", "job market", "labor market", "registered nurses", "mnesotawisconsin metropolitan area", "bLS", "demand curve", "labor employers", "salary", "wage rate", "ceteris paribus", "quantity", "labor demand", "labor supply curves", "derived demand", "chefs", "restaurant meals", "prescription drugs", "futurework", "trends", "challenges", "work", "21st century", "china", "technology", "wage inequality", "nulla vitae elit libero", "pharetra", "price Floors", "labor market", "living wages", "price ceilings", "u", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "minimum wage", "price floor", "equilibrium wage", "federal minimum wage", "unskilled", "minimum wage", "law of demand", "lowskill employment", "work hours", "job losses", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "04-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market - Explain how interest\n  rates can affect supply and demand - Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt\n  in terms of domestic financial markets - Explain the role of price ceilings and\n  usury laws in the U.S.\nUnited States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015.\nWhere did that savings go and how was it used?\n \nSome of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.\nIn this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital (i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the Financial Markets chapter.\nWho Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?\nIn any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms, depending on the type of investment.\nThe simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate. For example, when you supply money into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the money you borrow.\nFigure 4.5 illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the financial market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis shows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate.\nFigure 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards\n- In this market for credit card borrowing, the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at equilibrium E. Here, the interest rate is 15% and the quantity of financial capital loaned and borrowed is $600 billion.\n- At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion.\n- At a below-equilibrium interest rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial capital supplied would decrease to $510 billion.\nTable 4.5 shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity that credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.\n  \n    Interest Rate (%)\n    Quantity of Financial Capital Demanded (Borrowing) ($ billions)\n    Quantity of Financial Capital Supplied (Lending) ($ billions)\n  \n  \n    11\n    $800\n    $420\n  \n  \n    13\n    $700\n    $510\n  \n  \n    15\n    $600\n    $600\n  \n  \n    17\n    $550\n    $660\n  \n  \n    19\n    $500\n    $720\n  \n  \n    21\n    $480\n    $750\n  \nTable 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards\nThe laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to the law of demand, a higher rate of return will decrease the quantity demanded and a lower rate of return will increase the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises and credit becomes more expensive, consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. If, however, credit becomes cheaper, consumers will borrow more.\nAccording to the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease.\nEquilibrium in Financial Markets\nFigure 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards\nIn the financial market for credit cards in Figure 4.5, if the interest rate is above the equilibrium level, then an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to $480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the equilibrium level.\nIf the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion, but the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.\n  \n  \n    \n       The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit cards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED website.\n    \n  \nShifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\nThose who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their savings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.\nParticipants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions across a period of time, sometimes a long period.\nMost workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the left.\nBy contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.\n  \n    \n    In the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident\n    that investments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their\n    demand for financial capital shifted to the right. Conversely, during the 2008\n    and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any given interest\n    rate shifted to the left.\n  \n \nTo this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types of financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers will shift their funds to Investment B\u2014and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.\nThe United States as a Global Borrower\nIn the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with one of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.\nmissing Carousels\nThe Effect of Growing U.S. Debt\nImagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less desirable place to put their money because of fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?\nStep 1.\nFigure 4.6 The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty\nDraw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy.\n- Figure 4.6 above shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors.\n- The diagram shows the demand for financial capital from, and supply of financial capital into, the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt.\n- The original equilibrium E0 occurs at an equilibrium rate of return R0 and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.\nStep 2.\nWill the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S. financial assets will be seen as more risky.\nStep 3.\nWill supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors' for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left. Figure 4.7 shows the supply curve shift from S0 to S1.\nFigure 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty\nThe graph shows the demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before and after the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.\nStep 4.\nThus, foreign investors' diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E1, which occurs at the higher interest rate, R1, and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q1. In short, U.S. borrowers will have to pay more interest on their borrowing.\nThe economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2015, U.S. investors had accumulated $23.3 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign investors owned a total of $30.6 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their money out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower quantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in borrowing.\nIn a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between one bank account and another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and supply as markets for goods or labor.\nLearn with Videos\nPrice Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws\nAs we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.\nConsider the credit card market that Figure 4.8 illustrates. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This graph does not use specific numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic relationships.\nFigure 4.8 Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example\n- The original intersection of demand D and supply S occurs at equilibrium E0.\n- However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium interest rate R0, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium.\n- At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded, Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs.\n- There is excess demand, also called a shortage.\nImagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R0 that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal dashed line at interest rate Rc in Figure 4.8 shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q0 to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q0 to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied.\nConsequently, a number of people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.\n  \n    Many states do have usury laws, which impose an upper limit on the\n    interest rate that lenders can charge.\n  \n  \n    However, in many cases, these upper limits are well above the market\n    interest rate.\n  \n \nFor example, if the interest rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["suppliers", "financial market", "interest rates", "domestic financial markets", "price ceilings", "demand", "supply", "financial markets", "interest rate", "savings account", "bank", "interest", "equilibrium", "financial markets", "credit cards", "excess supply", "financial capital", "credit card", "supply", "financial markets", "financial investments", "intertemporal decision making", "upi", "global economy", "financial investment", "foreign countries", "us", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "price ceiling", "financial markets", "usury laws", "interest payments", "fees", "credit card", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "04-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities - Explain the\n  effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities\nPrices exist in markets for goods and services, labor, and financial capital. In all of these markets, prices serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant to the market\u2014namely, the relationship between demand and supply\u2014and then conveying that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person\u2019s preferences and budget set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits.\nThe following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models.\nClear It Up\nWhy are demand and supply curves important?\nThe demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples. It is a model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyze any market.\nFigure 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves\n- Figure 4.9 displays a generic demand and supply curve.\n- The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital.\n- The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.\n- We can use the demand and supply curves to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.\nThe demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at each price\u2014that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves\u2014and how these forces will combine to produce equilibrium.\nWe can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are only four possibilities:\n1. the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right or\n2. ... to shift left, or\n3. it may cause the supply curve to shift right or\n4. ... to shift left.\nThe key to analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves.\n  \n    Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same time, the\n    overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts. When there are\n    multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it\n    independently.\n  \n \nAn increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage; therefore, they may want to economize on buying this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.\nIn the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production as a result.\nThe actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive.\nThere is an old proverb: \u201cDon\u2019t kill the messenger.\u201d In ancient times, messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information. Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this information, it becomes difficult for everyone\u2014buyers and sellers alike\u2014to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur throughout the economy.\nThose who seek to maintain price controls are trying to kill the messenger\u2014or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. For example, during China\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This was communist party leader Mao Zedong's social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy to a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization, which resulted in human tragedy.\nBring It Home\nBaby Boomers Come of Age\nThe theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as Figure 4.10 shows. The impact of that increase will result in an average salary higher than the $67,490 earned in 2015 referenced in the first part of this case. The new equilibrium (E1) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe1).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from Qe0 to Qe1.\nFigure 4.10 Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2014-2024\nIn 2014, the median salary for nurses was $67,490. As demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D0 to D1) and the equilibrium quantity of nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equilibrium salary increases from Pe0 to Pe1.\nSuppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve in Figure 4.11 captures the impact of a decreasing supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for nurses, but the overall impact in the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply and demand.\nFigure 4.11 Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2014 and 2024\nThe increase in demand for nurses shown in Figure 4.10 leads to both higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As nurses retire from the work force, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in the supply curve and higher salaries for nurses at Pe2. The net effect on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which in this representation is less than Qe1, but more than the initial Qe0.\nWhile we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know they will have higher salaries.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["supply models", "price controls", "social mechanism", "buyers", "sellers", "marketoriented", "demand", "supply curves", "fundamental diagram", "opportunity set model", "long division", "baby boomers", "labor markets", "healthcare needs", "average salary", "equilibrium price", "demand curve", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "05-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the supply side - Evaluate\n  how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP) - Contrast and calculate GDP,\n  net exports, and net national product\nHow large is the U.S. Economy? Economists typically measure the size of a nation\u2019s overall economy by its gross domestic product (GDP), which is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of different goods and services\u2014smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college education, and all other new goods and services that a country produced in the current year\u2014and summing them into a total dollar value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In 2016, the U.S. GDP totaled $18.6 trillion, the largest GDP in the world. In addition to the total GDP, economists use GDP per capita\u2014GDP divided by a country's population.\nEach of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an economy's GDP either by the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or by the total dollar value of what is the country produces. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.\nLearn with Videos\nGDP Measured by Components of Demand\nWho buys all of this production? We can divide this demand into four main parts:\n1. Consumer spending (consumption)\n2. Business spending (investment)\n3. Government spending on goods and services,\n4. Spending on net exports.\nThis method of arriving at the GDP is called the Expenditure Approach. Table 5.1 shows how these four components added up to the GDP in 2016.\n  \n    \n      Components\n      Components of GDP on the Demand Side (in trillions of dollars)\n      Percentage of Total\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Consumption\n      $12.8\n      68.8%\n    \n    \n      Investment\n      $3.0\n      16.1%\n    \n    \n      Government\n      $3.3\n      17.7%\n    \n    \n      Exports\n      $2.2\n      11.8%\n    \n    \n      Imports\n      \u2013$2.7\n      \u201314.5%\n    \n    \n      Total GDP\n      $18.6\n      100%\n    \n  \nTable 5.2 Components of U.S. GDP in 2016: From the Demand Side (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index\\nipa.cfm)\nFigure 5.3 shows the levels of consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP.\nFigure 5.3 Percentage of Components of U.S. GDP on the Demand Side\nFigure 5.4 (a) below shows the levels of consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while Figure 5.4 (b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about each of these components are worth noticing.\nFigure 5.4 Components of GDP on the Demand Side\n(a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been on a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly over time.\n(b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index\\nipa.cfm)\nClear It Up\nWhat does the word \u201cinvestment\u201d mean?\nWhat do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction, and inventories. Inventories that manufacturers produce this year are included in this year's GDP\u2014even if they are not yet sold. From the accountant's perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2016 was $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n  \n    \n    Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting\n    for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year.\n  \n \nThis tells us that consumers' spending decisions are a major driver of the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much, and has increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s. (see Figure 5.4, panel (a)).\nInvestment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these expenditures under business investment. Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about 15\u201318% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back sharply.\nIf you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the 2009 recession, you have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the United States is close to 20% of GDP and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state, and local.\nThe only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local government spending). A significant portion of government budgets consists of transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran\u2019s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government excludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nClear It Up\nHow do statisticians measure GDP?\nGovernment economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece together estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.\n  \n    \n      Consumption\n    \n    \n        Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, Census Bureau carries out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. Between these years, they conduct a monthly survey of retail sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data to account for exports that are produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing  and residential finance. Together, these sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Investment\n    \n    \n      For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical capital equipment.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Government\n    \n    \n      For what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because the government at all levels spends a considerable amount on hiring people to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending through payroll records that state governments and the Social Security Administration collect.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Imports/Exports\n    \n    \n      With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial services that are produced in the United States for foreign customers as well as financial services produced overseas for US customers.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Other Data Sources\n    \n    \n      Many other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality collects information on healthcare. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on farming.\n    All these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce GDP estimates every three months, or every quarter. The BEA then \"annualizes\" these numbers by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates. BEA releases the GDP \u201cadvance\u201d estimate for a certain quarter one month after a quarter.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Preliminary vs. Final Data Estimates\n    \n    \n      The \u201cpreliminary\u201d estimate comes out one month after that. The BEA publishes the \u201cfinal\u201d estimate one month later, but it is not actually final. In July, the BEA releases roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once every five years, after it has processed all the results of the latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of the past GDP estimates according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.\n    \n  \nWhen thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to count spending on exports\u2014domestically produced goods that a country sells abroad. Similarly, we must also subtract spending on imports\u2014goods that a country produces in other countries that residents of this country purchase. The GDP net export component is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of imports (M), (X \u2013 M). We call the gap between exports and imports the trade balance. If a country's exports are larger than its imports, then a country has a trade surplus. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as Figure 5.4(b) shows.\nSince the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. Figure 6.4 (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009. As we noted before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.\nBased on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:\n  \n    GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government + Trade balance \n    GDP = C + I + G + (X \u2013 M)\n  \nUnderstanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for thinking about macroeconomic policy tools.\n  \n  \n    \n     FAQs from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\n    You can even email your own questions    \n  \nGDP Measured by What is Produced\nEverything that we purchase somebody must first produce. Table 5.2 breaks down what a country produces into five categories:\n- durable goods,\n- nondurable goods,\n- services,\n- structures,\n- change in inventories.\n  \n    \n      \n      Components of GDP on the Supply Side (in trillions of dollars)\n      Percentage of Total\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Durable goods\n      $3.0\n      16.1%\n    \n    \n      Nondurable goods\n      $2.5\n      13.4%\n    \n    \n      Services\n      $11.6\n      62.4%\n    \n    \n      Structures\n      $1.5\n      8.1%\n    \n    \n      Change in inventories\n      $0.0\n      0.0%\n    \n    \n      Total GDP\n      $18.6\n      100%\n    \n  \nTable 5.2 Components of U.S. GDP on the Production Side, 2016 (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index\\nipa.cfm)\nFigure 5.5 Percentage of Components of GDP on the Production Side\nBefore going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand. Figure 5.5 provides a visual representation of this information.\nSince every market transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, GDP must be the same whether measured by what is demanded/consumed or by what is produced. Figure 5.6 shows these components of what is produced, expressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1960.\nFigure 6.6 Types of Production\n- Services are the largest single component of total supply, representing over 60 percent of GDP, up from about 45 percent in the early 1960s.\n- Durable and nondurable goods constitute the manufacturing sector, and they have declined from 45 percent of GDP in 1960 to about 30 percent in 2016.\n- Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping to below the share of durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP.\n- Structures hover around 10% of GDP.\n- We do not show here the change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than 1% of GDP.\nIn thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone calls.\nEven within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories.\nAnother Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach\nThe primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure Approach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a firm produces, when sold, becomes revenues to the firm. Businesses use revenues to pay their bills: wages and salaries for labor, interest and dividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the entrepreneur, etc. Adding up all the income produced in a year, from all the factors of production, provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP and national income (denoted as Y) are sometimes used interchangeably. The total value of a nation\u2019s output is equal to the total value of a nation\u2019s income.\nLearn with Videos\nThe Problem of Double Counting\nWe define GDP as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting, in which they count output more than once as it travels through the production stages. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker sold that contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have counted the value of the tires twice-because the truck's price includes the value of the tires.\nTo avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes. Statisticians exclude intermediate goods, which are goods that go into producing other goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only count the Ford truck's value. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of the production chain.\nNotice the items that are not counted into GDP, as Table 5.3 outlines. The sales of used goods are not included because they were produced in the previous year and are part of that year\u2019s GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid \u201cunder the table\u201d and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is impossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider's recent study of shadow economies, he estimated the underground economy in the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone. Transfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not represent production. Also, production of some goods\u2014such as home production as when you make your breakfast\u2014is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.\n  \n    \n      What is Counted in GDP\n      What is not included in GDP\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Consumption\n      Intermediate goods\n    \n    \n      Business investment\n      Transfer payments and non-market activities\n    \n    \n      Government spending on goods and services\n      Used goods\n    \n    \n      Net exports\n      Illegal goods\n    \n  \nTable 5.3 Counting GDP\nOther Ways to Measure the Economy\nBesides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that we can think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also think of it as total income since anything one produces and sells yields income.\nOne of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product (GNP). GDP includes only what country produces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts any payments that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send home to other countries. In other words, GNP is based more on what a country's citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located, and GDP is based on what happens within a certain county's geographic boundaries. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be substantial.\nWe calculate net national product (NNP) by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation. We can further subdivide NNP into national income, which includes total income earned by the factors of production owned by a country\u2019s citizens.\nFor practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of how these calculations work, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.\nWork It Out\nmissing Carousels\nCalculating GDP, Net Exports, and NNP\nBased on the information in Table 5.4:\n1.

The distinction is between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The nominal value of any economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of actual prices that exist at the time. The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it is the real value that is more important.\nConverting Nominal to Real GDP\nTable 5.5 shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using the actual market prices prevailing in each stated year.

This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal GDP as the quantity of every final good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.\nFigure 5.8 U.S. GDP Deflator, 1960\u20132010\nThe GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them in chapter on inflation, but this definition will suffice in the context of this chapter. Table 5.5 provides the GDP deflator data and Figure 5.8 shows it graphically.\nFigure 5.8 shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in 1960). Clearly, much of the growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in other words, not in real GDP.\n  \n    \n    Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons:\n  \n \n  \n    - an increase in output.\n  \n \n  \n    - and/or an increase in prices.\n  \n \nWhat is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated dollars of 1990\u2014and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where:\n  \n    Value = Price \u00d7 Quantity or Nominal GDP = GDP Deflator \u00d7 Real GDP\u00a0\n  \n \nLet\u2019s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price of $9 each.\n  \n    Coolshirt's nominal revenue from sales = Price \u00d7 Quantity = $9 \u00d7 10 = $90\n  \n \nThen,\n  \n    Coolshirt's real income = Nominal revenue/Price = $90/$9 = 10\n  \n \nIn other words, when we compute \u201creal\u201d measurements we are trying to obtain actual quantities, in this case, 10 t-shirts.\nWith GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:\n  \n    Real GDP = Nominal GDP/Price Index\n  \n \nFor reasons that we will explain in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What this means is that when we \u201cdeflate\u201d nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index), we also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work. Thus, the formula becomes:\n  \n    Real GDP = (Nominal GDP x 100)/Price Index\n  \n \n  \n    \n      Nominal GDP = GDP Deflator \u00d7 Real GDP\n    \n    \n      Real GDP = Nominal GDP / Price Index\n    \n    \n      Real GDP = (Nominal GDP x 100) / Price Index\n    \n  \nComputing GDP\nWork It Out\nComputing GDP\nWe can use the data in Table 5.5 to compute real GDP.\nStep 1. Look at Table 5.5, to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price index (GDP deflator) was 19.0.\nStep 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:\nReal GDP = (Nominal GDP \u00d7 100)/Price Index\n= $543 billion \u00d7 100/19\n= $2,859.5 billion\nWe\u2019ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price index:\n- 19 divided by 100 = 0.19.\n- Then divide into nominal GDP: $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.\nStep 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.\nReal GDP = (Nominal GDP \u00d7 100)/Price Index\n= $743.7 billion \u00d7 100/20.3\n= $3,663.5 billion\nStep 4.\nContinue using this formula to calculate all of the real GDP values from 1960 through 2010.

Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a special role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices we use to compute the real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this case, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real GDP is labeled \u201cConstant Dollars\u201d or, in this example, \u201c2005 Dollars,\u201d which means that real GDP is constructed using prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2005 as the base year, more generally, you can use any year as the base year. The formula is:\nGDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP \u00d7 100) / Real GDP\nRearranging the formula and using the data from 2005, we get the following:\nReal GDP = (Nominal GDP \u00d7 100)/Price Index\n= $13,094.5 billion \u00d7 100/100\n= $13,095.4 billion\nComparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2005, you see they are the same. This is no accident. It is because we have chosen 2005 as the \u201cbase year\u201d in this example. Since the price index in the base year always has a value of 100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are always the same in the base year.\nLook at the data for 2010.\nReal GDP = (Nominal GDP \u00d7 100)/Price Index\n= $14,958.3 billion \u00d7 100/110\nSummary\nUse this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is positive, meaning prices increase on average from year to year, real GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year. The reason for this is that the value of nominal GDP is \u201cinflated\u201d by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is positive, real GDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year before the base year.\nFigure 5.9 U.S. Nominal and Real GDP, 1960\u20132012\nThe purple line measures U.S. GDP in nominal dollars. The blue line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars, where all dollar values are converted to 2005 dollars. Since we express real GDP in 2005 dollars, the two lines cross in 2005. However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the years before 2005, because dollars were worth less in 2005 than in previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear lower in the years after 2005, because dollars were worth more in 2005 than in later years.\nLet\u2019s return to the question that we posed originally: How much did GDP increase in real terms? What was the real GDP growth rate from 1960 to 2010? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for percentage change:\n  \n    \n    ((2010 real GDP \u2013 1960 real GDP 1960) \u00d7 100) / real GDP 1960 = % change ((13,598.5\n    \u2013 2,859.5) \u00d7 100) / 2859 = 376%\n  \n \n  \n    \n    In other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of goods and services\n    by nearly a factor of four since 1960. Of course, that understates the material\n    improvement since it fails to capture improvements in the quality of products\n    and the invention of new products.\n  \n \nThere is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using another math trick. Because:\n  \n    Nominal = Price \u00d7 Quantity % change in Nominal = % change in Price + %\n    change in Quantity or, % change in Quantity = % change in Nominal \u2013 % change\n    in Price\n  \n \nTherefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in value) minus the inflation rate (% change in price).\nNote that using this equation provides an approximation for small changes in the levels. For more accurate measures, we should use the first formula.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["gdp deflator", "nominal gdp values", "real measurements", "inflation rate", "binocular", "real gb", "nominal dollars", "market prices", "nominal gb deflator", "year", "gdp", "gb", "cmos implementation", "vendorsupplied hardware", "gdp deflator", "price index", "gdp arithmetic", "netledger", "mgh", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "05-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain recessions, depressions, peaks, and troughs - Evaluate the importance\n  of tracking real GDP over time\nWhen news reports indicate that \u201cthe economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter,\u201d the reports are referring to the percentage change in real GDP. By convention, governments report GDP growth is at an annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, we multiply it by four when it is reported as if the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.\nFigure 5.10 shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900. Short term declines have regularly interrupted the generally upward long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP a recession. We call an especially lengthy and deep recession a depression. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the 1930s Great Depression is clearly visible in the figure, as is the 2008\u20132009 Great Recession.\nFigure 6.10 U.S. GDP, 1900\u20132016\nReal GDP in the United States in 2016 (in 2009 dollars) was about $16.7 trillion. After adjusting to remove the effects of inflation, this represents a roughly 20-fold increase in the economy\u2019s production of goods and services since the start of the twentieth century.\nCalculating Real GDP\nReal GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.\nDuring a recession losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best\u2014or their employers may ask them to take pay cuts.\n  \n    \n    The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger,\n    uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in production means that firms\n    need to lay off or fire some of their workers.\n  \n \n  \n    \n      Trough\n      Peak\n      Months of Contraction\n      Months of Expansion\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      December 1900\n      September 1902\n      18\n      21\n    \n    \n      August 1904\n      May 1907\n      23\n      33\n    \n    \n      June 1908\n      January 1910\n      13\n      19\n    \n    \n      January 1912\n      January 1913\n      24\n      12\n    \n    \n      December 1914\n      August 1918\n      23\n      44\n    \n    \n      March 1919\n      January 1920\n      7\n      10\n    \n    \n      July 1921\n      May 1923\n      18\n      22\n    \n    \n      July 1924\n      October 1926\n      14\n      27\n    \n    \n      November 1927\n      August 1929\n      23\n      21\n    \n    \n      March 1933\n      May 1937\n      43\n      50\n    \n    \n      June 1938\n      February 1945\n      13\n      80\n    \n    \n      October 1945\n      November 1948\n      8\n      37\n    \n    \n      October 1949\n      July 1953\n      11\n      45\n    \n    \n      May 1954\n      August 1957\n      10\n      39\n    \n    \n      April 1958\n      April 1960\n      8\n      24\n    \n    \n      February 1961\n      December 1969\n      10\n      106\n    \n    \n      November 1970\n      November 1973\n      11\n      36\n    \n    \n      March 1975\n      January 1980\n      16\n      58\n    \n    \n      July 1980\n      July 1981\n      6\n      12\n    \n    \n      November 1982\n      July 1990\n      16\n      92\n    \n    \n      March 1991\n      March 2001\n      8\n      120\n    \n    \n      November 2001\n      December 2007\n      8\n      73\n    \n  \nTable 5.7 U.S. Business Cycles since 1900\n\n  \n    \n    A private think tank, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), tracks\n    business cycles for the U.S. economy.

When comparing the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise:\n1. First, we measure a country's GDP in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common currency.\n2. A second issue is that countries have very different numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has almost three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus, if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.\nConverting Currencies with Exchange Rates\nTo compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d using an exchange rate, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. We express exchange rates either as the number of units of country A\u2019s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B\u2019s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British pounds per Japanese yen).\nWe can use two types of exchange rates for this purpose:\n1. Market exchange rates\n2. Purchasing power parity (PPP) equivalent exchange rates.\n   Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer running measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange rates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common currency.\nWork It Out\nmissing Carousels\nConverting GDP to a Common Currency\nUsing the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to compare Brazil's GDP in 2013 of 4.8 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $16.6 trillion for the same year.\nStep 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2013, the exchange rate was 2.230 reals = $1. (These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)\nStep 2. Convert Brazil\u2019s GDP into U.S. dollars:\nBrazil's GDP in $ U.S. = Brazil's GDP in reals / Exchange rate (reals/$ U.S.)\n                               = 4.8 trillion reals/2.230 reals per $ U.S.\n= $2.2 trillion\nStep 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the same year. The U.S. GDP was $16.6 trillion in 2013, which is nearly eight times that of GDP in Brazil in 2013.\nStep 4.\nCountry\nGDP in Billions of Domestic Currency\nDomestic Currency/U.S. Dollars (PPP Equivalent)\nGDP (in billions of U.S. dollars)\nBrazil\n4,844.80\nreals\n2.157\n2,246.00\n  Canada\n  1,881.20\n  dollars\n  1.030\n  1,826.80\n  China\n  58,667.30\n  yuan\n  6.196\n  9,469.10\n  Egypt\n  1,753.30\n  pounds\n  6.460\n  271.40\nGermany\n2,737.60\neuros\n0.753\n3,636.00\nIndia\n113,550.70\nrupees\n60.502\n1,876.80\nJapan\n478,075.30\nyen\n97.596\n4,898.50\nMexico\n16,104.40\npesos\n12.772\n1,260.90\nSouth Korea\n1,428,294.70\nwon\n1,094.925\n1,304.467\nUnited Kingdom\n1,612.80\npounds\n0.639\n2,523.20\nUnited States\n16,768.10\ndollars\n1.000\n16,768.10\nView Table 5.10 which shows the size of and variety of GDPs of different countries in 2013, all expressed in U.S. dollars.

The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China and India. Is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries, or is it actually larger on a per-person basis? We can answer this question by calculating a country\u2019s GDP per capita; that is, the GDP divided by the population.\n  \n    GDP per capita = GDP/population\n  \n \n  \n    \n      Country\n      GDP (in billions of U.S. dollars)\n      Population (in millions)\n      Per Capita GDP (in U.S. dollars)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Brazil\n      2,246.00\n      199.20\n      11,275.10\n    \n    \n      Canada\n      1,826.80\n      35.10\n      52,045.58\n    \n    \n      China\n      9,469.10\n      1,360.80\n      6,958.48\n    \n    \n      Egypt\n      271.40\n      83.70\n      3,242.90\n    \n    \n      Germany\n      3,636.00\n      80.80\n      44,999.50\n    \n    \n      India\n      1,876.80\n      1,243.30\n      1,509.50\n    \n    \n      Japan\n      4,898.50\n      127.3\n      38,479.97\n    \n    \n      Mexico\n      1,260.90\n      118.40\n      10,649.90\n    \n    \n      South Korea\n      1,304.47\n      50.20\n      25,985.46\n    \n    \n      United Kingdom\n      2,523.20\n      64.10\n      39,363.50\n    \n    \n      United States\n      16,768.10\n      316.30\n      53,013.28\n    \n  \nTable 5.11 GDP Per Capita, 2013\nNotice that the ranking by GDP is different from the ranking by GDP per capita. India has a somewhat larger GDP than Germany, but on a per capita basis, Germany has more than 10 times India\u2019s standard of living. Will China soon have a better standard of living than the U.S.? Read the following Clear It Up feature to find out.\nClear It Up\nIs China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of living?\nAs Table 5.11 shows, China has the second largest GDP of the countries: $9.5 trillion compared to the United States' $16.8 trillion. Perhaps it will surpass the United States, but probably not any time soon. China has a much larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fifth that of the United States ($6,958.48 compared to $53,013). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed countries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the differences in living standards across countries.\nThe world's high-income nations\u2014including the United States, Canada, the Western European countries, and Japan\u2014typically have GDP per capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries, which include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the range of $6,000 to $12,000. The world's low-income countries, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often have GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["gdp", "economic welfare", "common currency", "us dollar", "canadian dollar", "exchange rates", "gdp", "foreign exchange markets", "pppequ", "gdp", "common currency", "brazil", "exchange rate", "us", "gdp", "us economy", "china", "india", "per", "china", "standard of living", "gdp", "usa", "western europe", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "05-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living - Explain the limitations\n  of GDP as a measure of the standard of living - Analyze the relationship between\n  GDP data and fluctuations in the standard of living\nThe level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase \u201cstandard of living.\u201d Most of the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.\n\u201cStandard of living\u201d is a broader term than GDP, though. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets, standard of living includes all elements that affect people\u2019s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to the standard of living.\nLimitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living\nWhile GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours.\nThe GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as Table 5.11 showed, but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher?\nNot necessarily, since it is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year than the average German worker. Calculating GDP does not account for the German worker\u2019s extra vacation weeks.\nWhile GDP includes what a country spends on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are cleaner or dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.\nGDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP.\n  \n    One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is the growth in\n    women\u2019s participation in the labor force. As of 1970, only about 42% of\n    women participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the\n    2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in the paid labor force according to\n    the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  \n \nAs women are now in the labor force, many of the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people actually are not consuming more services.\nGDP per capita is only an average, and therefore says nothing about the level of inequality in society. When GDP per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less\u2014or even declined. GDP also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does not tell us whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others\u2014it just looks at the total amount the family spends on bread.\nLikewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not only affected by how much money people had\u2014it was also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.\nIn certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off. Similarly, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society\u2019s standard of living.\nDoes a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?\n  \n    \n    The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard\n    of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP over time are illusory.\n  \n \nIt is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.\nIn some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since 1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. Companies have developed new technologies for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates, or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.\nOn the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and income inequality are higher in the United States now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women primarily provided in the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.\nBring It Home\nHow is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?\nTo determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation\u2019s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.\nThe sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge\u2014as of the fourth quarter of 2016, $18.9 trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the 2008\u20132009 recession was severe and that the recovery from that recession has been slow, but the economy is improving. GDP per capita gives a rough estimate of a nation\u2019s standard of living. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related and what causes them to rise or fall.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["standard of living", "gdp", "GDP", "migration", "countries", "high gdp per", "gdp", "spending", "recreation", "travel", "germany", "paid labor force", "standard of living", "gdp per capita", "human health", "environmental cleanliness", "food", "gdp", "economic activity", "us economy", "goods", "services", "real", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "06-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic growth in the last\n  two centuries - Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy's long-run\n  economic growth\nLet's begin with a brief overview of spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last two centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of modern economic growth. (Later in the chapter we will discuss lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level, the average person's standard of living had not changed much for centuries.\nProgressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden, slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines\u2014the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive\u2014performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.\n  \n    Modern Economic Growth\n    Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race.\n    Industrial Revolution\n    The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the economic growth of the first half of the 1800s.\n  \nThe jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for more new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average GDP growth rate per capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per year.\nWhat were times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\nClear It Up\nWhat were economic conditions like before 1870?\nAngus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. to 1348. Table 6.1 is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. A wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress explain declines in income. Institutions are the traditions and laws by which people in a community agree to behave and govern themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.\nOne example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution later adopted this concept. This social order may have contributed to England's GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of northern Italy.\nIn studying economic growth, a country's institutional framework plays a critical role. Table 6.1 also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not in the table).\n  \n    \n      Year\n      Northern Italy\n      Spain\n      England\n      Holland\n      Byzantium\n      Iraq\n      Egypt\n      Japan\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      $800\n      $600\n      $600\n      $600\n      $700\n      $700\n      $700\n      -\n    \n    \n      730\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      $920\n      $730\n      $402\n    \n    \n      1000\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      $600\n      $820\n      $600\n      -\n    \n    \n      1150\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      $580\n      $680\n      $660\n      $520\n    \n    \n      1280\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      $670\n      $527\n    \n    \n      1300\n      $1,588\n      $864\n      $892\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      $610\n      -\n    \n    \n      1348\n      $1,486\n      $907\n      $919\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n      -\n    \n  \nTable 6.1 GDP Per Capita Estimates in Current International Dollars from AD 1 to 1348 (Source: Bolt and van Zanden. \u201cThe First Update of the Maddison Project. Re-Estimating Growth Before 1820.\u201d 2013)\nAnother fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of income, compared to others at that time, attained by the Islamic Empire Abbasid Caliphate\u2014which was founded in present-day Iraq in 730 C.E. At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.\nThe Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP per capita of the world's poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.\nHowever, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible.\n- Japan\u2019s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per-capita averaging 11% per year during those decades.\n- Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973.\n- In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per-capita were not uncommon.\n- More recently, China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a per-capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s.\n- India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per-capita of about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.\nThese waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.4 billion) and India (population: 1.3 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.\nEconomic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. Richard Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:\n  \n    \n    \u201cBy many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world.\n    Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors\n    two centuries ago. They are healthier, live longer, and are better educated.\n    Women\u2019s lives are less centered on reproduction and political democracy has gained\n    a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of\n    this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th\n    century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to\n    participate. Although the picture is not one of universal progress, it is the\n    greatest advance in the human condition of the world\u2019s population ever achieved\n    in such a brief span of time.\u201d\n  \n \n  \n    \n    Richard Easterlin- Economist, University of Southern California\n  \n \n>\nLearn with Videos\nLink It Up\n  \n  \n    \n      Visit this website to read about the Asian Development Bank.\n    \n  \nRule of Law and Economic Growth\nEconomic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country\u2019s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society.\nProperty rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is what determines your livelihood. Using this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.\nContractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects payment. Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The theft is property the services that the surgeon provided. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of the patient\u2013surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\nThe World Bank considers a country's legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries' legal systems based on effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe. Their GDP per capita was $679, $333, and $1,007 respectively. The World Bank cites Afghanistan as having a low standard of living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had declining and often negative growth for much of the period since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["economic growth", "public policies", "powerdriven machinery", "social changes", "economic", "economic conditions", "1870", "quantitative economic historian", "national incomes", "gdp per capita", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "asia development bank", "china netcom", "customer service", "it managers", "selection", "rule of law", "economic growth", "property rights", "contractual rights", "government", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "06-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth - Analyze\n  the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function - Measure\n  an economy's rate of productivity growth - Evaluate the power of sustained growth\n  \n    \n    Sustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity,\n    which essentially means how well we do things. In other words, how efficient\n    is your nation with its time and workers?\n  \n \nLabor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the Canadians are more productive. More productivity means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.\nWhat determines how productive workers are? There are three factors: human capital, technological change, and economies of scale.\n  \n    \n      Human Capital\n    \n    \n        The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital. Human capital is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience), skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically, the higher the average level of education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Technological Change\n    \n    \n      The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. Technological change is a combination of invention\u2014advances in knowledge\u2014and innovation, which is putting those advances to use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less time, improving worker productivity.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Economies of Scale\n    \n    \n     The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size.\n    Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that the Canadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard residential size oven.\n    \n  \nNow that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let's turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity.\nSources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function\nTo analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a production function, which is the technical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are turned into outputs like goods and services that consumers use. A microeconomic production function describes a firm's or an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy an aggregate production function.\nComponents of the Aggregate Production Function\nFigure 6.2 Aggregate Production Functions\nEconomists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies.\nFigure 6.2 presents two examples of aggregate production functions.\nIn the first production function in Figure 6.2 (a), the output is GDP.\nIn the second production function in Figure 6.2(b), the output is GDP per capita. The inputs in both functions are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology.\nWe discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.\nMeasuring Productivity\nAn economy's rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital.\nA common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer's output.\nNote: This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy.\nFigure 7.3 Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947\u20132011\nOutput per hour worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1950s and the 1960s compared with the 1970s and 1980s.\nFigure 6.3 shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the base year (when the index equals 100).\nIn 2014, the index equaled about 106.\nIn 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.\nAccording to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity growth by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001. Figure 6.4 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950.\nFigure 6.4 Productivity Growth Since 1950\n- U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1950 and 1970.\n- It then declined to lower levels in the 1970s and the 1980s.\n- The late 1990s and early 2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity decreased by a small amount in the 2000s.\n- Some think the productivity rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a \u201cnew economy\u201d built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\nThe \u201cNew Economy\u201d Controversy\nIn recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a \u201cnew economy\u201d based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down since then.\nProductivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy.

For both measures, growth in Australia is greater than growth in Belgium for the first four years. In addition, there are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth. For example, one factor that may have contributed to Australia's stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who generally contribute to economic growth.\nThe Power of Sustained Economic Growth\n  \n    \n    Nothing is more important for people\u2019s standard of living than sustained economic\n    growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded\n    over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living.\n  \n \nConsider Table 6.3, where the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time.\n  \n    \n      Growth Rate\n      Value of an original 100 in 10 Years\n      Value of an original 100 in 25 Years\n      Value of an original 100 in 50 Years\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1%\n      110\n      128\n      164\n    \n    \n      3%\n      134\n      209\n      438\n    \n    \n      5%\n      163\n      339\n      1,147\n    \n    \n      8%\n      216\n      685\n      4,690\n    \n  \nTable 6.3 Growth of GDP over Different Time Horizons\nAssume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:\n  \n    \n      GDP at starting date \u00d7 (1 + growth rate of GDP)years = GDP at end date\n    \n  \nFor example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)^25 = 209.\nThe slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. experienced during its strong economy in the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan, Korea, and China.\nTable 6.3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth\u2014from 100 to 163\u2014over just 10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates. If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sixfold by the time they reach age 45.\nClear It Up\nHow are compound growth rates and compound interest rates related?\nThe formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as Figure 7.3 shows, is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity. Both formulas have the same ingredients:\n1. An original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving.\n2. A percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth rate and in the other case an interest rate.\n3. And an amount of time over which this effect happens.\nRecall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or the compound growth rate, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that includes past GDP growth. This results in dramatic effects over time.\nFor example, in 2013, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of $1.67 trillion with a growth rate of 2.8%. We can estimate that at that growth rate, South Korea\u2019s GDP will be $1.92 trillion in five years. If we apply the growth rate to each year\u2019s year-end GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is $1.72 trillion. In year two, we start with the year-end GDP from year one, a value of $1.72 trillion, and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts with the year-end GDP from year two, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as Table 6.4 depicts.\n  \n    \n      Year\n      Starting GDP\n      Growth Rate 2.8%\n      Year-End Amount\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      $1.67 Trillion \u00d7\n      (1+0.028)\n      $1.72 Trillion\n    \n    \n      2\n      $1.72 Trillion \u00d7\n      (1+0.028)\n      $1.76 Trillion\n    \n    \n      3\n      $1.76 Trillion \u00d7\n      (1+0.028)\n      $1.81 Trillion\n    \n    \n      4\n      $1.81 Trillion \u00d7\n      (1+0.028)\n      $1.87 Trillion\n    \n    \n      5\n      $1.87 Trillion \u00d7\n      (1+0.028)\n      $1.92 Trillion\n    \n  \nTable 6.4\nAnother way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula:\n  \n     Future Value = Present Value \u00d7 (1 + g)^n \n  \n \nWhere \u201cfuture value\u201d is the value of GDP five years hence, \u201cpresent value\u201d is the starting GDP amount of $1.67 trillion, \u201cg\u201d is the growth rate of 2.8%, and \u201cn\u201d is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth.\n  \n     Future Value = 1.67 \u00d7 (1+0.028)^5 = $1.92 trillion \n  \n \nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["labor productivity", "economic growth", "aggregate production function", "longterm economic growth", "economic growth", "aggregate production function", "economic inputs", "labor", "machinery", "raw materials", "aggregate production function", "figure 62", "production functions", "gdp", "human", "productivity growth", "growth rate", "pg per capita", "government workers", "new economy", "usa", "productivity growth", "employment", "profitseeking employers", "gdp", "productivity", "udp", "organization for economic cooperation and development", "sustained economic growth", "gdp", "cumulative growth", "growth rate", "compensation rates", "gdp growth rates", "interest rate", "choice in a world of scarcity", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "06-03": {"text": "Introduction\nOver decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.\nThe category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads (also called infrastructure). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two ways:\n1. An increase in the quantity of physical capital (for example, more computers of the same quality)\n2. An increase in the quality of physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are faster, and so on).\nHuman capital refers to the skills and knowledge that make workers productive. Human capital and physical capital accumulation is similar: In both cases, investment now pays off in higher productivity in the future.\nThe category of technology is the \u201cjoker in the deck.\u201d Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.\n  \n    Physical Capital\n    The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads (also called infrastructure)\n    Human Capital\n     Human capital refers to the skills and knowledge that make workers productive.\n  \nFigure 6.2 Aggregate Production Functions\nTo obtain a per-capita production function, divide each input in Figure 6.2 (a) by the population. This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per-capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person\u2014see Figure 6.2 (b). Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population is important for the average person only if the rates of income growth and population growth are drastically different from each other. A more important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human and physical capital.\nCapital Deepening\n  \n    When society increases the level of capital per person, we call the result\n    capital deepening.\n  \n  \n    The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per\n    worker and to additional physical capital per worker.\n  \nFigure 6.5 Human Capital Deepening in the U.S. (Source: US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics)\nRising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy (see Figure 6.5). Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four- year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur.\nAs recently as 1970, for example, only about half of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of the twenty first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades.\n  \n    Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy\n    focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher average\n    level of work experience.\n  \nFigure 6.6 Physical Capital per Worker in the United States (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices, University of Pennsylvania)\nFigure 6.6 shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy.\nThe value of the physical capital, measured by plant and equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades.\nThe increase may have leveled off somewhat in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in worker productivity.\nWe see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early 2000s.\nThe average U.S. worker in the late 2000s was working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early 1950s.\nNot only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of technological marvels is all around us\u2014discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office typically has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.\nGrowth Accounting Studies\nSince the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured these three main factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.\n  \n    \n      1. Technology\n    \n    \n      Technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2. Human Capital\n    \n    \n    While investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years after World War II (1939 ~ 1945).\n    During the war, a large share of Europe\u2019s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic framework, rebuilt Europe\u2019s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.\n    \n  \n   \n    \n      3. Human Capital, Physical Capital, Technology\n    \n    \n        A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a part of new investment in physical capital.\n        New machines that embody technological innovations often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly impact lives.\n    \n  \nClear It Up\nHow do girls' education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?\nIn the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school\u2014and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the literacy rate for those aged 15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62% for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was 55% for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for females.\nWhenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low- income countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.\n  \n    \n    Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have\n    fewer, healthier, better- educated children.\n  \nThese girls' children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in low income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with benefits beyond the current generation.\nA Healthy Climate for Economic Growth\n  \n  \n    \n      While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are\n      important, equally important to a nation\u2019s well-being is the climate or\n      system within which these inputs are cultivated.\n    \n  \nBoth the type of market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a healthy economic climate.\nA healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to product improvement.\nCollectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.\nA general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a whole. The government's role is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets toward certain outcomes.\nThe following examples highlight some important areas that governments around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:\n- Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school (Folkeskole) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend Folkeskole. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies vouchers to citizens who choose private school.\n- Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, the government taxes gains from private investment. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.\n- Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately economic growth.\n- Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government-supported special economic zones (SEZ). These are areas of the country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board.\n- Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The researchers Abraham Garc\u00eda and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies. Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.\nThere are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth. We explore them in other chapters and in particular in Macroeconomic Policy Around the World. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["gdp", "economic growth", "physical capital", "human capital", "infrastructure", "computer", "human capital deepening", "usa economy", "education", "high school diploma", "growth accounting studies", "human capital", "aggregate production function", "per capita economic growth", "residual", "girls", "economic growth", "lowincome countries", "world bank", "children", "healthful climate", "economic growth", "legal system", "property rights", "contractual rights", "firm decision", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "06-04": {"text": "Arguments Favoring Convergence\nSeveral arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic growth in the future.\n1. A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns.\n    Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor's degree, would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to $15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.\n    Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the high-income countries achieve.\n  2. A second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to\n  improve their technologies than high-income countries.\nHigh-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood. The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904\u20131978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: \u201cthe advantages of backwardness.\u201d Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.\n  Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of\n  those that have grown more quickly and have learned from it.\nMoreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher standard\nof living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions\nthat will help provide this standard of living.\nLearn with Videos\nArguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely\n  \n  \n    \n    There is a crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.\n    \n  \nIf the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then we would expect that economy's growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology. Developing new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening. Figure 6.7 shows how.\nFigure 6.7 Capital Deepening and New Technology\nThe graph\u2019s horizontal axis measures the amount of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human capital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C1 to C2 to C3.\nThe diagram's vertical axis measures per capita output. Along the lowest aggregate production function, labeled Technology 1, the level of technology is held constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens from C1 to C2 to C3 and the economy moves from R to U to W, per-capita output does increase\u2014 but the line starts out steeper on the left and flattens as it moves to the right.\nThis shows diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will eventually set in.\nImagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital C1 and the output per-capita at G1. If the economy relies only on capital deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W.\nHowever, if capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology, then as capital deepens from C1 to C2, technology improves from Technology 1 to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C2 to C3, technology increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.\nNow, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate production functions.\nMost healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher Technology 3. With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per-capita in high-income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.\n  \n    \n    Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over\n    time? That is, will it become continually harder and more costly to discover\n    new technological improvements?\n  \n \nPerhaps someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that new technologies are often applicable to a wide array of industries at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. For example, a specific worker or group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an additional year of education. Many workers across the economy can use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.\nThe argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and using new technology, a society's performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the country's economic, educational, and public policy institutions are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain advantages is of little practical relevance.\n  \n  \n    \n      Rival Economists in Public Battle Over Cure for India\u2019s Poverty\n      Read More\n    \n  \nThe Slowness of Convergence\n  \n    \n    Although economic convergence between high-income countries and the rest of the\n    world seems possible and even likely, it will proceed slowly.\n  \n \nConsider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of $40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1+ 0.02)30) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is, $4,000 (1 + 0.07)30). Convergence has occurred. The rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy.\nEven after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down somewhat.\nThe slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in standard of living over decades\u2014more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.\nBring It Home\nCalories and Economic Growth\nWe can tell the story of modern economic growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more calories in 2017 than in 1875.\nAside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact, food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.\nBecause we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["lowincome countries", "worker productivity", "economic growth", "marginal returns", "average education level", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "capital deepening", "horizontal axis", "percapita output", "diminishing marginal returns", "human capital", "slowness", "convergence", "highincome countries", "impoverished countries", "india", "Guatemala", "calories", "economic growth", "calorie consumption", "neoclassical growth consensus", "aggregate", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "07-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Calculate the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate - Explain\n  hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of the labor force - Evaluate\n  the collection and interpretation of unemployment data\nNewspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a percentage or a rate. A recent report might have said, for example, \u201cFrom August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%.\u201d At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However, remember that the U.S. economy has about 160 million adults (as of the beginning of 2017) who either have jobs or are looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 160 million potential workers translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with the unemployment rate now at 4.8% as of January 2017, about 7.6 million people who would like to have jobs are out of work.\n  \n  \n    \n      The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks and reports all data related to unemployment.\n    \n  \nWho's In or Out of the Labor Force?\nShould we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count children as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on parental leave.\nThe point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason are not interested in having a job either.\nIt also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment. Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as discouraged workers\u2014workers out of the labor force or not in the labor force.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.\n  \n    Out of the labor force\n    Economists refer to the group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force.\n    Employed\n    currently working for pay\n    Unemployed\n    Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job\n    Labor force\n    The number of employed plus the unemployed.\n  \nLearn with Videos\nCalculating the Unemployment Rate\nFigure 7.1 Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and older), January 2017\nFigure 7.1 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population.\nThe total adult, working-age population in January 2017 was 254.1 million.\nOut of this total population, 152.1 million were classified as employed, and 7.6 million were classified as unemployed. The remaining 94.4 million were classified as out of the labor force.\nAs you will learn, however, this seemingly simple chart does not tell the whole story.\nAbout 62.9% of the adult population was \"in the labor force\"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed. Table 7.1 shows those values.\nThe unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:\n  \n    Unemployed rate = (Unemployed People / Labor Force) x 100\n  \nIn this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635 million unemployed people divided by 159.716 million people in the labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment.

There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who are underemployed. This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of work but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would consider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term \u201chidden unemployment.\u201d Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence, are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nAnother important statistic is the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in Figure 7.1 and Table 7.1, those included in this calculation would be the 159.716 million individuals in the labor force. We calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For the data from January 2017, the labor force participation rate is 62.9%. Historically, the civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly during and after that recession, reaching its present level, where it has remained stable, near the end of 2013.\n  \n    Unemployed\n    This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of work but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills.\n    Discouraged workers\n    Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence, are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group.\n    Labor force participation rate\n    TThis is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job.\n  \nLearn with Videos\nHow Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S. Unemployment Data?\nThe unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the first Friday of each month for the previous month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau has carried out every month since 1940. The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive months, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.\nAccording to this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education statistics are all factors that contribute to unemployment rates.\n  \n    \n    A wide variety of other information is available, too. For example, how long\n    have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because they quit, or\n    were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed person\n    the only wage earner in the family?\n  \n \nThe Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it Up feature.\nClear It Up\nWhat is the difference between CPS and EPS?\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\nCriticisms of Measuring Unemployment\nThere are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed people.\nFor example, what about people who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of available jobs in their area and stopped looking?\nSuch people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. However, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, childcare, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.\nAlthough the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.\nLearn with Videos\n  \n  \n    \n      Visit this website  to learn more about the CPS and to read frequently asked questions about employment and labor.\n    \n  \nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["unemployment rate", "hidden unemployment", "us economy", "potential workers", "unemployment", "adult population", "discouraged workers", "paid work", "us", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "unemployed", "out of the labor force distribution", "adult population", "workingage", "unemployment rate", "total adult", "workingage population", "total growth", "hidden unemployment", "employment", "underemployed", "temporary jobs", "permanent", "labor force participation rate", "adults", "economy", "unemployed", "total adult population", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "unemployment rate", "current population survey", "household clusters", "survey", "employment", "ups", "cps", "eps", "united states Census bureau", "current population survey", "unemployment rate", "survey", "economic statistics", "yard work", "childcare", "cleaning houses", "employment", "labor", "cps", "website", "employment", "management", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "07-02": {"text": "The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate\nFigure 7.2 shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment since 1955. The U.S. unemployment rate moves up and down as the economy moves in and out of recessions. However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of 4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower.\nFigure 7.2 The U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1955\u20132015 (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0)\nAs we look at this data, several patterns stand out:\n1. Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007\u20132009, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.\n2. Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006\u20132007, and 5% or slightly less from September 2015 through January 2017 (the latest date for which data are available as of this writing). The previous time unemployment had been less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.\n3. The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%\u2014and it stays that low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)\nThe timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity, and especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods of recession and depression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.\nNo significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324 million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2017. However, despite the increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.\nUnemployment Rates by Group\nUnemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. Figure 7.3 shows unemployment rates broken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.\nFigure 7.3 (a) Unemployment Rates by Gender (Source: www.bls.gov)\nUnemployment Rates by Gender\nUnemployment rates for men used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close, with the unemployment rate for men somewhat higher, especially during and soon after the Great Recession.\nThe unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as \u201csecondary\u201d earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men. During the 2008-2009 recession and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the unemployment rate for women. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed.\nFigure 7.3 (b) Unemployment Rates by Age (Source: www.bls.gov)\nUnemployment Rates by Ages\nUnemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process of matching workers with jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics.\nFigure 7.3 (c) Unemployment Rates by Race and Ethnicity (Source: www.bls.gov)\nUnemployment Rates by Race and Ethnicity\nAlthough unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate for black workers is typically about twice as high as that for whites, while the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers is in between.\nFinally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In January 2017, for example, the unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.5%; for those with some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate was 3.8%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the unemployment rate was 5.3%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 7.7%. This pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and higher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities like lower pay for low-skilled workers compared to the opportunities for more highly-skilled workers, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to find jobs.\nLink It Up\nRead this report for detailed information on the 2008\u20132009 recession.

For example, Japan\u2019s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan\u2019s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan\u2019s unemployment rate probably paints too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced hours or officially employed despite doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual method to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.\nComparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Census Bureau. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low-income countries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and food assistance. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than in high-income countries.\n  \n  \n    \n      We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time.

What causes changes\n    in unemployment? There are different answers in the short run and in the long\n    run. Let's look at the short run first.\n  \n \nCyclical Unemployment\nLet's make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard ceteris paribus assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant factors.\nOne primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call the variation in unemployment that the economy causes moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle) cyclical unemployment.\nFrom the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as Figure 7.4 illustrates, the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers.\nFigure 7.4 The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor Market\nIn a labor market with flexible wages, the equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people who want jobs (shown by S) equals the number of jobs available (shown by D).\nOne possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist\u2019s perspective, these people are choosing to be unemployed because they are not actively looking for employment in the current labor market.\nProbably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work in the same conditions. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed.\nLearn with Videos\nWhy Wages Might Be Sticky Downward\nIf a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well\u2014because it predicts that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job\u2014then it may prove useful to consider economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.\n  \n    \n    One set of reasons why wages may be \u201csticky downward,\u201d as economists put it,\n    involves economic laws and institutions.\n  \n \nFor low-skilled workers receiving minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 150 million or so employed workers in the U.S. economy, only about 2.6 million\u2014less than 2% of the total\u2014do not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly, labor unions represent only about 11% of American wage and salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of workers. However, for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor force.\nEconomists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. Many have proposed a number of different theories, but they share a common tone.\nOne argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract, which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave the firm.\n  \n    \n      Efficiency wage theory\n    \n    \n      Efficiency wage theory argues that workers' productivity depends on their\n      pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees\n      somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is that\n      employees who receive better pay than others will be more productive\n      because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs, they\n      would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work\n      harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know\n      that it is costly and time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so\n      they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose\n      them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts,\n      the employer minimizes costs of training and hiring new workers, and reaps\n      the benefits of well-motivated employees.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Adverse selection of wage cuts argument\n    \n    \n      The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer\n      reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then\n      the best workers, those with the best employment alternatives at other\n      firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with\n      fewer employment alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently,\n      firms are more likely to choose which workers should depart, through\n      layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board.\n      Sometimes companies that are experiencing difficult times can persuade\n      workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of the\n      firm\u2019s workers. However, it is far more typical for companies to lay off\n      some workers, rather than to cut wages for everyone.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      The insider-outsider model\n    \n    \n      The insider-outsider model of the labor force, in simple terms, argues\n      that those already working for firms are \u201cinsiders,\u201d while new employees,\n      at least for a time, are \u201coutsiders.\u201d A firm depends on its insiders to\n      keep the organization running smoothly, to be familiar with routine\n      procedures, and to train new employees. However, cutting wages will\n      alienate the insiders and damage the firm\u2019s productivity and prospects.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Relative wage coordination argument\n    \n    \n      Finally, the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if\n      most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own\n      wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such\n      a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to\n      implement such a plan. Instead, workers confronted with the possibility of\n      a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut,\n      and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and\n      relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard against wage cuts.\n    \n  \nFigure 7.5 Sticky Wages in the Labor Market\nThese theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-term or long-term unemployment can result, as illustrated in Figure 7.5.\nBecause the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the number of those who want jobs (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment, shown by the bracket in the figure.\nFigure 7.6 shows the interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward.\nFigure 7.6 Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand?\nFigure 7.6 (a) illustrates when demand for labor shifts to the right from D0 to D1. In this case, the equilibrium wage rises from W0 to W1 and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from Q0 to Q1. It does not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.\nFigure 7.6 (b) shows when demand for labor shifts to the left from D0 to D1, as it would tend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been the new equilibrium wage (W1), at least not in the short term. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve, the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers demanded at that wage has declined from Q0 to Q2. The gap between the original equilibrium quantity (Q0) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q2) represents workers who would be willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of unemployment.\nThis analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted earlier:\n- Unemployment tends to rise in recessions and to decline during expansions.\n- The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes.\n- The rise in unemployment that occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.\n  \n  \n    \n      Visit  the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)  web site, which provides complete data sets on various measures of the unemployment rate as well as the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on the results of the household and employment surveys.\n    \n  \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["unemployment", "sticky wages", "employment", "economic arguments", "supply and demand models", "long", "unemployment", "equilibrium wage", "flexible labor markets", "ceteris paribus assumption", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "labor market model", "flexible wages", "unemployment", "economic models", "union workers", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "07-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain frictional and structural unemployment - Assess relationships between\n  the natural rate of employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and public\n  policy - Identify recent patterns in the natural rate of employment - Propose ways\n  to combat unemployment\nCyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic expansion, but what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times in the last few decades.\n  \n    \n    Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing strongly?\n  \n \n  \n    \n    Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good\n    economic years and bad?\n  \n \nEconomists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy: the natural rate of unemployment.\nThe Long Term: The Natural Rate of Unemployment\n  \n    \n    The natural rate of unemployment is not \u201cnatural\u201d in the sense that water freezes\n    at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical\n    and unchanging law of nature.\n  \n \nInstead, it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social, and political factors that exist at a time\u2014assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their work forces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let\u2019s discuss these factors in more detail.\nFrictional Unemployment\nIn a market economy, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons:\n- Old technology;\n- Poor management;\n- Good management that happened to make bad decisions;\n- Shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm's product is desired;\n- A large customer who went broke;\n- Tough domestic or foreign competitors.\nConversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones.\nIn the real world, however, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job.\nEconomists call the unemployment that occurs as workers move between jobs as frictional unemployment.\nFrictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing. It takes time on the part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.\nIn the mid-2000s, before the 2008\u20132009 recession, about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.\n  \n    \n    These forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting\n    their workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces that affect\n    the labor market, or public policies that affect either the eagerness of people\n    to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let\u2019s discuss these factors\n    in more detail.\n  \n \nThe extent of frictional unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find jobs, which in turn may depend on history and culture.\nFigure 7.3(b) Unemployment Rates for Women, by Age\nFrictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population. Figure 7.3 (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25\u201354 years of age or aged 55 and over than they are for those who are younger. \u201cPrime-age workers,\u201d as those in the 25\u201354 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and income arriving at all times. In addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for retirement. By contrast, it is likely that a relatively high proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs and life options, and this leads to greater job mobility and hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with a relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers began entering the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers in older ages.\nStructural Unemployment\nAnother factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment.\n  \n    \n    The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack\n    skills valued by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away from\n    the skills they do have, or because they never learned any skills.\n  \n \nAn example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.\nSome people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no skills and little education, that option is more limited.\nNatural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP\nThe natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP. Economists consider the economy to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real GDP. By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers working overtime.\nLearn with Videos\nProductivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\n  \n  \n    \nUnexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment.\nOver time, workers' productivity determines the level of wages in an economy.\n  \nAfter all, if a business paid workers more than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.\nHowever, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. Employers typically review wages only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level.\n  \n    \n    How precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is\n    one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation?\n  \n \nBecause productivity is difficult to observe, employers often determine wage increases based on recent experience with productivity. If productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.\nThe U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in Economic Growth). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982.\nFigure 7.7 (a) illustrates how the demand for labor\u2014that is, the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage\u2014has been shifting out a little each year because of rising productivity, from D0 to D1 to D2. As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from W0 to W1 to W2. However, when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W2 to W3 to W4, but the demand for labor is no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W4 is greater than the quantity demanded, and the natural rate of unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly low productivity in the 1970s, the unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May 1980 until 1986. Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease back down, but this process may take years.\nFigure 7.7 (a) Productivity is rising, increasing the demand for labor, and employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops increasing, but the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift immediately. Wages keep rising as before, but the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage W4, unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded.\nFigure 7.7 (b) The rate of productivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D0 to D1. At the wage (W), this means that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.\nFigure 7.7 Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment\nThe late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980\u20131995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995\u20132001. Let\u2019s simplify the situation a bit, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in Figure 7.7 (b), where the demand curve for labor (D0) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages were not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from D0 to D1. At least for a time, wages are still set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low\u2014below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%\u2014quite a low level by historical standards\u2014from 1998 until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.\nLevels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and conversely somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. However, over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.\nPublic Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\n  \n    \n    Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment.\n    On the supply side of the labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed\n    can affect how eager people are to find work.\n  \n \nFor example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food assistance, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of unemployment is lower and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.\nWhat seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely, government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people to return to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.\nClear It Up\nHow does U.S. unemployment insurance work?\nUnemployment insurance is a joint federal\u2013state program that the federal government enacted in 1935. While the federal government sets minimum standards for the program, state governments conduct most of the administration.\nThe funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires tax collection on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that they pay benefits, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks\u2014with extensions possible in times of especially high unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the person earned in his or her previous job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.\n  \n    \n      Bottom 10 States That Pay the Lowest Benefit per Week\n      Top 10 States That Pay the Highest Benefit per Week\n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Delaware\n      $330\n      Massachusetts\n      $672\n    \n    \n      Georgia\n      $330\n      Minnesota\n      $683\n    \n    \n      South Carolina\n      $326\n      Washington\n      $681\n    \n    \n      Missouri\n      $320\n      New Jersey\n      $657\n    \n    \n      Florida\n      $275\n      North Dakota\n      $633\n    \n    \n      Tennessee\n      $275\n      Connecticut\n      $598\n    \n    \n      Alabama\n      $265\n      Oregon\n      $590\n    \n    \n      Louisiana\n      $247\n      Pennsylvania\n      $573\n    \n    \n      Arizona\n      $240\n      Colorado\n      $568\n    \n    \n      Mississippi\n      $235\n      Rhode Island\n      $566\n    \n  \nTable 7.5 Maximum Weekly Unemployment Benefits by State in 2017\nOne other interesting thing to note about the classifications of unemployment is that an individual does not have to collect unemployment benefits to be classified as unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied relating to how many people are collecting unemployment insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate information.\nOn the demand side of the labor market, government rules, social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that a company can sell. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where companies can conduct business, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.\n  \n    \n    Government rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push\n    up wages for union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring\n    those workers.\n  \n \nWhatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value\u2014like the value some Christians place on not working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant Muslims on Saturday\u2014these kinds of restrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary, since laying these workers off would be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers.\nThe Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years\n  \n    \n    The underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural\n    rate of unemployment can change over time, which means that the natural rate\n    of unemployment can change over time, too.\n  \n \nEstimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than before 2000. We outline three of the common reasons that economists propose for this change below.\n1. The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An internet search is far easier than trying to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources departments, and requesting a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work as well.\n2. The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies. By the early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or obtained any other way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.\n3. The aging of the \u201cbaby boom generation\u201d\u2014the especially large generation of Americans born between 1946 and 1964\u2014meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As we noted earlier, middle-aged and older workers are far more likely to experience low unemployment than younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.\nThe combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The 2008\u20132009 Great Recession pushed monthly unemployment rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%. During the last four months of 2015 the unemployment rate held steady at 5.0%. Throughout 2016 and up through January 2017, the unemployment rate has remained at or slightly below 5%. As of the first quarter of 2017, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the natural rate to be 4.74%, and the measured unemployment rate for January 2017 is 4.8%.\nBring It Home\nUnemployment and the Great Recession\nAt the start of this chapter, we noted that unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator of business activity. This has historically been the case, and it is evident for all recessions that have taken place since the end of World War II. In brief, this results from the costs to employers of recruitment, hiring, and training workers. Those costs represent investments by firms in their work forces.\nAt the outset of a recession, when a firm realizes that demand for its product or service is not as strong as anticipated, it has an incentive to lay off workers. However, doing so runs the risk of losing those workers, and if the weak demand proves to be only temporary, the firm will be obliged to recruit, hire, and train new workers.\nThus, firms tend to retain workers initially in a downturn. Similarly, as business begins to pick up when a recession is over, firms are not sure if the improvement will last. Rather than incur the costs of hiring and training new workers, they will wait, and perhaps resort to overtime work for existing workers, until they are confident that the recession is over.The duration of recoveries in employment following recessions has been longer following the last three recessions (going back to the early 1990s) than previously. Nir Jaimovich and Henry Siu have argued that these \u201cjobless recoveries\u201d are a consequence of job polarization: the disappearance of employment opportunities focused on \u201croutine\u201d tasks.\nJob polarization refers to the increasing concentration of employment in the highest- and lowest-wage occupations, as jobs in middle-skill occupations disappear. Job polarization is an outcome of technological progress in robotics, computing, and information and communication technology.\nThe result of this progress is a decline in demand for labor in occupations that perform \u201croutine\u201d tasks \u2013 tasks that are limited in scope and can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures \u2013 and hence a decline in the share of total employment that is composed of routine occupations. Jaimovich and Siu have shown that job polarization characterizes the aftermath of the last three recessions, and this appears to be responsible for the jobless recoveries.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["unemployment", "structural unemployment", "natural rate", "employment", "potential real gdp", "unemployment rate", "political factors", "economic factors", "social factors", "job market", "frictional unemployment", "market economy", "employees", "job seekers", "job vacancies", "social", "structural unemployment", "natural rate", "unemployment", "aerospace engineers", "high school dropouts", "natural unemployment rate", "full employment", "potential real gdp", "natural unemployment rate", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "productivity shifts", "natural rate of unemployment", "competitive labor market", "business sector", "public policy", "natural rate of unemployment", "welfare benefits", "food assistance", "government medical benefits", "unemployment insurance", "federal government", "minimum standards", "state governments", "federal tax collection", "natural rate of unemployment", "us economy", "temp job", "human resources departments", "unemployment", "Great recession", "business activity", "job polarization", "employment opportunities", "middle", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "08-01": {"text": "The Price of a Basket of Goods\nTo calculate the price level, economists complete the following steps:\n1. Begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services, consisting of the different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy.\n2. Look at how the prices of those items change over time.\nIn thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others. Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%.\nTo construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based on a few products.\nWork It Out\nCalculating an Annual Rate of Inflation\nConsider the simple basket of goods with only three items. Say that in any given month, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table provides prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. Table 8.2 shows the cost of buying the given basket of goods at the prices prevailing at that time.\n  \n    \n      Items\n      Hamburger\n      Aspirin\n      Movies\n      Total\n      Inflation Rate\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Qty\n      20\n      1 bottle\n      5\n      -\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 1) Price\n      $3.00\n      $10.00\n      $6.00\n      -\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 1) Amount Spent\n      $60.00\n      $10.00\n      $30.00\n      $100.00\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 2) Price\n      $3.20\n      $10.00\n      $6.50\n      -\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 2) Amount Spent\n      $64.00\n      $10.00\n      $32.50\n      $106.50\n      6.5%\n    \n    \n      (Pd 3) Price\n      $3.10\n      $10.00\n      $7.00\n      -\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 3) Amount Spent\n      $62.00\n      $10.00\n      $35.00\n      $107.00\n      0.5%\n    \n    \n      (Pd 4) Price\n      $3.50\n      $10.00\n      $7.50\n      -\n      -\n    \n    \n      (Pd 4) Amount Spent\n      $70.00\n      $10.00\n      $37.50\n      $117.50\n      9.8%\n    \n  \nTable 8.2 A College Student's Basket of Goods\nTo calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example, complete the following steps:\n1. Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation, is:\n   (Level in new year - Level in previous year) / Level in previous year x 100 = Percentage change\n2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in Table 8.2 rises from $100 to $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time\u2014the inflation rate\u2014is:\n   (106.50 - 100) / 100 = 0.065 = 6.5%\n3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to $107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:\n   (107 - 106.50) / 106.5 = 0.0047 = 0.47%\n4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:\n   (117.50 - 107) / 107 = 0.098 = 9.8%\nThis calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student spends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced. If an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then changes in the price of that good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person\u2019s money. The larger impact of hamburgers shows up in the \u201camount spent\u201d row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the amount spent row.\nIndex Numbers\n  \n    \n    Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change in relative\n    prices over time.\n  \n \nThe numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in Table 8.2 has only three goods and the prices are in rounded dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27.654.92.\nTo simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods, economists typically report the price level in each period as an index number, rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year, or the starting point from which we measure changes in prices.\nThe base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example of the college student in the previous Work It Out section, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself and multiply by 100. Again, this is because the index number in the base year must always have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.\nTable 8.3 shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in Table 8.2. Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the percentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be\n(99.5 \u2013 93.4) / 93.4 = 0.065 = 6.5%\nThis is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of goods for the same time period.\n  \n    \n      \n      Total Spending\n      Index Number\n      Inflation Rate Since Previous Period\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Period 1\n      $100\n      1001.0793.4\n      \n    \n    \n      Period 2\n      $106.50\n      106.501.0799.5\n      \n        99.56.5%\n      \n    \n    \n      Period 3\n      $107\n      1071.07100.0\n      \n        1000.5%\n      \n    \n    \n      Period 4\n      $117.50\n      117.501.07109.8\n      \n        109.89.8%\n      \n    \n  \nTable 8.3 Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year\n  \n    \n    If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index\n    numbers, then why bother with the index numbers?\n  \n \nThe advantage is that indexing allows for easier approximation of inflation numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and $20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to glance at those kinds of numbers and approximate a change of about 3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous example. If you\u2019re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn\u2019t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nClear It Up\nWhy do you not just subtract index numbers?\nA word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not exactly 3%. Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-change calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as 100 x (110 \u2013 107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible shortcut to calculating the inflation rate\u2014but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the right answer.\nTwo final points about index numbers are worth remembering:\n1. Index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them.\n   Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we find in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with.\n2. The choice of a base year of 100 is arbitrary.\n   We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base year when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%.\nNow that we see how indices work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure the cost of living.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["price of a basket of goods", "services", "individual prices", "overall price level", "weighted", "in", "aspirin", "college student", "hamburgers", "movies", "price", "price indices", "overall average change", "relative prices", "base year", "dollar amount", "inflation rate", "price index", "percentagechange calculation", "base year", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "08-02": {"text": "Substitution Bias\nWhen the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead. Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important.\nConsider, as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes\u2014not a very likely assumption.\n  \n    Substitution bias \u2014 the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods\n    over time\u2014tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s true cost of living,\n    because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away\n    from goods whose relative prices have risen.\n  \nQuality/New Goods Bias\nThe other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals and that it costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price reflects a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer Price Index (CPI), must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for quality changes.\nWe can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in quality\u2014from something that did not exist to something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods and services in the CPI is revised and updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. The process of adding new products takes some time, however. Take the following trends in products for example:\n- Room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of goods behind the CPI until 1964.\n- The VCR and personal computer were available in the late 1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987.\n- By 1996, there were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States\u2014but cell phones were not yet part of the CPI basket of goods until 1998.\nThe parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind, as the arrival of new goods makes it difficult to measure inflation accurately. The reason people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways the cost of living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether.\nThe following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how statisticians comprise and calculate the CPI.\n  \n    The quality/new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a\n    fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s\n    true cost of living, because it does not account for how improvements in the\n    quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the\n    standard of living.\n  \nClear It Up\nHow do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. We do this by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending habits. Statisticians divide consumer expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn they divide into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982\u20131984 as the base period.\nFor each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the prices of those examples. In figuring out the \u201cbreakfast cereal\u201d item under the overall category of \u201cfoods and beverages,\u201d the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-item categories. Statisticians rotate about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample each year, and replace them with a different set of products.\nThe next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. The BLS also conducts a survey of 50,000 landlords or tenants to collect information about rents.\nStatisticians then calculate the CPI by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them into price indices for the 200 or so overall items, using weights (see Figure 8.2) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements. Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items into an overall CPI.\nAccording the CPI website, there are eight categories that data collectors use. Click on each number label to learn more about the category.\nThe Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index\nFigure 8.2 The Weighting of CPI Components Of the eight categories used to generate the Consumer Price Index. (Source: www.bls.gov/cpi)\n  \n  \n    \n      Visit the Ford Model T page on the Wikipedia to view a list of Ford car prices between 1909 and 1927. Consider how these prices compare to today\u2019s models. Is the product today of a different quality?\n    \n  \nThe CPI and Core Inflation Index\nImagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck's operating condition. However, the manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck's on-time performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the company manager would be paying attention to the firm's production, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted you, but did not affect the company's bottom line.\nIn a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we've learned, CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending. Economists typically calculate a core inflation index by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.\nExamples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation's gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation's economic capability.\n  \n    \n    The core inflation index] provides a better guide to monetary policy than the\n    other indices, since it measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather\n    than transitory influences on the price level.\n  \n  \n    \n    Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, 1999\n  \n \nBernanke also noted that it helps communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need to respond to every inflationary shock since some price changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.\nThe CPI and core CPI are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.\n  \n    Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n    Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four.\n    Core Inflation Index:\n    Economists typically calculate a core inflation index by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables.\n  \nLearn with Videos\nPractical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases\n  \n  \n    \n      By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was using more complex mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to allow for some substitution between goods.\n    \n  \nIt was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently, so that it could include new and improved goods more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other product characteristics, and then calculate the change in price after accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional economists.\nBy the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much. Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.\n  \n    When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff\n    arises between simplicity and interpretation.\n  \nIf we calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the calculation is straightforward. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate grow more complex.\nAdditional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More\nThe basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index (CPI) represents an average hypothetical U.S. household's consumption, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone\u2019s personal experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine.\n  \n    \n    What if, however, you are concerned about inflation experienced by a certain\n    group, like the elderly, the poor, single-parent families with children, or Hispanic-\n    Americans?\n  \n \nIn specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer may not feel quite right.\nThis problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or housing.\nThe BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods.\n- The Producer Price Index (PPI) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services. We can break it down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of processing, like finished goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further processing.\n- An International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.\n- An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market.\n- The GDP deflator, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year's GDP would have been worth using the base-year's prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).\n  \n    \n    What\u2019s the best measure of inflation?\n  \n \nIf one is concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, one should use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good measure of the cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (e.g., aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers).\nIf one wants the most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, one should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the BLS states on its website:\n  \n    The \u2018best\u2019 measure of inflation for a given application depends on the\n    intended use of the data.\n  \n \n  \n    \n    The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n  \n \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["substitution bias", "price", "good rises", "peaches", "food", "substitution theory", "quality", "new goods", "fixed basket of goods", "price index", "room air conditioners", "consumer price index", "us government statisticians", "consumer expenditures", "individual", "core inflation index", "company truck", "gas prices", "energy", "food prices", "transit", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "subitution", "qualitynew goods", "bLS", "consumer price index", "improved", "price indices", "pki", "gdp deflator", "consumer price index", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "08-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify patterns of inflation for the United States using data from the Consumer\n  Price Index - Identify patterns of inflation on an international level\nIn the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index typically rising 2% to 4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods where inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to hyperinflation.\nHow the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation\nFigure 8.3 (a) shows the level of prices in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stretching back to 1913. In this case, the base years when the CPI is defined as 100 are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to 1984. Figure 8.3 (b) shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time, which is the inflation rate.\nFigure 8.3 U.S. Price Level and Inflation Rates since 1913 \nGraph (a) shows the trends in the U.S. price level from the year 1913 to 2016. In 1913, the graph starts out close to 10, rises to around 20 in 1920, stays around 16 or 17 until 1931, then falls to 13 or 14 until 1940. It gradually increases until about 1973, then increases more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and beyond, with periodic dips, until 2016, when it reached around 240.\nGraph (b) shows the trends in U.S. inflation rates from the year 1914 to 2016. In 2014, the graph starts out with inflation at almost 8%, jumps to about 17% in 1917, drops drastically to close to \u201311% in 1921, goes up and down periodically, with peaks in the 1940s and the 1970s, until settling to around 1.3% in 2016.\nThe first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation\u2014called deflation\u2014in the early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep 1920-21 recession and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nSince inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases. For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year.\nA third wave of more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.\nTimes of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of 1920\u20131921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980\u20131982, and the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009. There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate.\nHigh levels of unemployment typically accompany recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.\n  \n  \n    \nVisit the CPI Inflation Calculator web site to discover how prices have changed in the last 100 years.\n  \nInflation around the World\nFigure 8.4 Countries with Relatively Low Inflation Rates, 1960\u20132016\nAround the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed; Figure 8.4 shows inflation rates over the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high inflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan's inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have largely stayed down.\nCountries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low rates of measured inflation\u2014because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard the statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced hyperinflation\u2014an outburst of high inflation\u2014of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia's consumer price inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as Figure 8.5 shows. The closest the United States has ever reached hyperinflation was during the 1860\u20131865 Civil War, in the Confederate states.\nFigure 8.5 Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates, 1980\u20132016 (Sources: Inflation, consumer prices for Brazil; Consumer Price Index: All Items for China)\nThese charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year\u2019s consumer prices in Brazil, China, and Russia.\n(a) Of these, Brazil and Russia experienced very high inflation at some point between the late-1980s and late-1990s.\n(b) Though not as high, China also had high inflation rates in the mid-1990s. Even though their inflation rates have come down over the last two decades, several of these countries continue to see significant inflation rates.\nMany countries in Latin America experienced raging inflation during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation rates often well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in 1995.\nIn the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent years, the world's worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)\u2014that is, the bills had $100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["inflation", "usa", "consumer price index", "hyperinflation", "inflation rate", "consumer price index", "base years", "buying power", "goods", "services", "inflation", "countries with relative low inflation rates", "united states", "europe", "consumer", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "08-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain how inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power - Identify\n  ways inflation can blur the perception of supply and demand - Explain the economic\n  benefits and challenges of inflation\nEconomists usually oppose high inflation, but not to the extent that many non-economists do. Robert Shiller, one of 2013\u2019s Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked,\n  \n    \n    \u201cDo you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority,\n    as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality\n    of our schools?\u201d\n  \n \nAnswers were on a scale of 1\u20135, where 1 meant \u201cFully agree\u201d and 5 meant \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d\nFor the U.S. population, 52% answered \u201cFully agree\u201d that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4% said \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d However, among professional economists, only 18% answered \u201cFully agree,\u201d while the same percentage of 18% answered \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d\nIt is clear from Shiller\u2019s survey that there is some confusion over inflation. In this section, we will consider the economic problems caused by inflation, and why economists often regard them with less concern than the general public.\nThe Land of Funny Money\nOne morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone's pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone's savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices ended up not mattering much at all.\nWhen the people in Robert Shiller's surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.\n  \n    \n    Economists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly\n    similar to the inflation level in wages.\n  \n \nThey reason that, on average, over time, people\u2019s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of Funny Money, then no one\u2019s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended redistributions of purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.\nUnintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power\nInflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation include those who are holding considerable cash, some wage earners, and retirees on defined benefits plans. People who can benefit from inflation are borrowers of fixed rate loans.\nPeople with Considerable Financial Assets\nWhen inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However, cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is negative 1%, and the money itself is worth less.\nThe problem of a good-looking nominal interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest on the $500 received\u2014no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain\u2014but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is negative 5% and the person is actually falling behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.\nWage Earners\nInflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time, eventually. The last row of Table 8.1 at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly wage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $20.65 in 2017, which is an increase by a factor of more than six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as Figure 8.6 shows.\nFigure 8.6 U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation (Sources: History of Federal Minimum Wage Rates Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1938 - 2009; CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U))\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse\u2014as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has continued to decline.\nRetirees on Defined Benefits Plans\nOne sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, economists call pensions \u201cdefined benefits\u201d plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.\nFortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount to the worker's retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their 401(k) comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.\nBorrowers with Fixed Interest Rate Loans\nOrdinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then he or she must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower\u2019s benefit from inflation is the lender\u2019s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. When interest rates are fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are worth less because of inflation. Demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.\nThe unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation causes may have a broader effect on society. America\u2019s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people\u2019s actions have a reasonable connection to market outcomes. It is difficult to accept that a retiree might suffer from inflation, despite building up a pension or investing at a fixed interest rate, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from inflation. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any useful effects of inflation. One of the reasons that the general public dislikes inflation is a sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary\u2014and therefore seemingly unfair. This can even result in dangerous politicians taking advantage of public sentiment, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.\nClear It Up\nIs there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler's rise to power?\nGermany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:\n  \"A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany,\n  is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark\u2019s\n  inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923\n  alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 \u00d7 1028%), came in the same month\n  as did Hitler\u2019s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party\u2019s armed attempt to overthrow\n  the German government. This failed putsch resulted in Hitler\u2019s imprisonment,\n  at which time he wrote his book Mein Kampf, setting forth an inspirational\n  plan for Germany\u2019s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .\n  . . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these\n  events; this lack of attention to it may be because its memory is blurred by\n  the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and\n  World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in\n  sequence . . . the putsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the\n  potential effects of inflation.\"\n  - Robert Shiller, 1996\nBlurred Price Signals\nPrices are the messengers in a market economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like a radio program received with considerable static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.\nIn Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather difficult.\nWhen the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high but variable rate, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, supply of that good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic hint to start substituting other products, or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production, or is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will presumably become clear over time, but in a given moment, who can say?\nHigh and variable inflation means that the incentives for the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages.\nProblems of Long-Term Planning\nInflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the rate of future inflation.\nInflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can make money from inflation\u2014for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see inflation eroding the value of that cash. However, when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff occurs: less time is spent on improving products and services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services cheaper. An economy with high inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation. These are not necessarily the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.\nIn the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies.\nThe evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation\u2019s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20\u201330% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s\u2014to 10%\u2014U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as Figure 8.7 shows.\nFigure 8.7 U.S. Inflation Rate and U.S. Labor Productivity, 1961\u20132014\nOver the last several decades in the United States, there have been times when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower productivity rates and lower inflation rates have corresponded to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however, this correlation does not always exist.\nAny Benefits of Inflation?\nAlthough the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two points are worth noting:\n1. The impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe recessions.\n2. Economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible. The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could help real wages to decline slightly if necessary. In this way, though a moderate or high rate of inflation may keep the economy from growing, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as a stimulant for the labor market.\nThis final argument is controversial, though. A full analysis would have to account for all the effects of inflation. It does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be especially harmful.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["inflation", "purchasing power", "survey", "high inflation", "drug abuse", "schools", "land of funny money", "interest rates", "wallets", "retirement", "purchasing power", "blurred price signals", "inflation", "purchasing power", "defined benefits plans", "fixed rate loans", "interest rate", "germany", "hyperinflation", "mark", "weimar republic", "great depression", "social turmoil", "inflation", "market economy", "conditions of demand", "supply", "radio program", "inflation", "longterm planning", "planning problems", "unintended redistributions", "pension", "inflation", "economic effects", "moderate inflation", "wages", "labor markets", "hyper", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "08-05": {"text": "Indexing in Private Markets\nThere are three types of indexing that occur in private markets: cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARM), and business contracts that have automatic adjustments for inflation.\n  \n    \n      Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)\n    \n    \n      In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts\n      that had cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) which guaranteed that their\n      wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were sometimes written\n      as, for example, \u201cCOLA plus 3%.\u201d Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage\n      increase would automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage\n      increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied\n      to wages.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan (ARM)\n    \n    \n      Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the\n      inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then the interest rate that\n      a financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points\n      as well. An adjustable- rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan that one can\n      use to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of\n      inflation. Often, a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if\n      borrowing with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that\n      with an ARM, the lender is protected against the risk that higher\n      inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part\n      of the interest rate can be correspondingly lower.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Business Contracts with Automatic Adjustments for Inflation\n    \n    \n      Many ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that\n      prices will adjust automatically according to inflation. Sellers like such\n      contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if\n      inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts\n      because they are not locked into a high buying price if inflation turns\n      out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for\n      inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather\n      than a nominal price.\n    \n  \nIndexing in Government Programs\nMany government programs are indexed to inflation, including the U.S. income tax code, the U.S. Social Security program, and indexed bonds.\n  \n    \n      U. S. Income Tax Code\n    \n    \n        The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person\u2019s income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. This is what the expression \u201cmove into a higher tax bracket\u201d means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2017 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to $9,325; 15% of all income from $9,326 to $37,950; 25% of all taxable income from $37,951 to $91,900; 28% of all taxable income from $91,901 to $191,650; 33% of all taxable income from $191,651 to $416,700; 35% of all taxable income from $416,701 to $418,400; and 39.6% of all income from $418,401 and above.\n    Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine the exact amount of taxes an individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this \u201cbracket creep\u201d. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Social Security\n    \n    \n      The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain amount\u2014$117,000 in 2014. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the benefit level.\n    \n  \n   \n    \n      Indexed Bonds\n    \n    \nAs another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S. government began offering indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation\u2014no matter the level of inflation\u2014can be a very comforting investment.\n    \n  \nMight Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?\nIndexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of inflation.\nHowever, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it most.\nBring It Home\nA $550 Million Loaf of Bread?\nAs we will learn in Money and Banking, the existence of money provides enormous benefits to an economy. Money is what greases the gears of markets. It makes transactions easier. It allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the money earned to purchase the other products they need to live.\nToo much money in circulation, however, can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy reverts to barter, or it adopts another country\u2019s more stable currency, like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.\nOnly national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation. Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The only option is to print money\u2014more and more of it. With more money in circulation chasing the same amount (or even fewer) goods and services, the only result is increasingly higher prices until the economy and/or the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of letting inflation spiral out of control.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["indexing", "private markets", "costofliving adjustments", "adjustablerate mortgage loans", "government programs", "index", "government programs", "us income tax code", "inflation", "government programs", "arbitrary redistributions", "costs", "revenues", "interest", "inflation", "money", "banking", "employment", "barter", "stable currency", "u", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "09-01": {"text": "The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line\nFirst Conceptual Line: Potential GDP\nFigure 9.2 The Expenditure-Output Diagram\nThe first conceptual line is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of both its labor and physical capital. We discuss potential GDP in much more detail in Chapter 9 The Aggregate Demand/ Aggregate Supply Model.\nSecond Conceptual Line: The 45-Degree Line\nThe second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.\nMacroeconomic Equilibrium\nWhen the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP. By definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal\u2014which can only occur along the 45-degree line.\nThe Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\nThe final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which shows the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line\u2014at point E0 in Figure 9.2\u2014will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP.

The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises.\nThus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line, \u2014(1) consumption, (2) investment, (3) government spending, (4) exports and imports or net exports.\n  \n    \n    The key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national\n    income rises.\n  \n \nConsumption as a Function of National Income\n  \n    \n    How do consumption expenditures (C) increase as national income rises?\n  \n \nPeople can do two things with their income: consume it or save it. Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice.\n- The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures.\n- The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save.\n  It must always hold true that:\nMPC + MPS = 1  \nFor example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.\nChanges in Consumption (and Savings) as National Incomes Increases\nWith this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown on the consumption function in Figure 9.8 below.\n  \n    Note that we use \u201cAggregate Expenditure\u201d on the vertical axis in this and\n    the following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of\n    aggregate expenditures. An assumption commonly made in this model is that\n    even if income were zero, people would have to consume something. For an\n    intuitive example, consider non-working full-time college students with zero\n    income, but who still have to consume a bundle of goods in order to sustain\n    themselves.\n  \nFigure 9.8 The Consumption Function\nIn the example in Figure 9.8, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Economists call this number the intercept of the consumption function and the vertical axis autonomous consumption or autonomous expenditure.\nAutonomous consumption/expenditure is the portion of the expenditure or spending that is not related to current income.\nWhen consumption is at $600 as shown in Figure 9.8, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rise by $200. Because both of these changes are result of changes in income first, we call them induced consumption / expenditure and savings.\nAt an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the MPC of 0.8, or $3,200, for a total of $3,800.\nThe total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical. This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in Figure 9.8 and Table 9.1, is called the consumption function.\n  \n    \n    In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level\n    of national income?\n  \n \n- Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy.\n- At a national income level of zero, $600 is consumed and -$600 is saved (or \u201cdissaved\u201d).\n- Each time income rises by $1,000, consumption and savings rise by $800 and $200, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume and save are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.\nThe pattern of consumption shown in Table 9.1 is plotted in Figure 9.8:\n- To calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero.\n- To calculate savings, multiply the income level by 0.2, for the marginal propensity to save, and add negative $600, for the amount that would be saved even if income was zero.\n- Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.\n  \n    Income\n    Consumption\n    Savings\n  \n  \n    $0\n    $600\n    -$600\n  \n  \n    $1,000\n    $1,400\n    -$400\n  \n  \n    $2,000\n    $2,200\n    -$200\n  \n  \n    $3,000\n    $3,000\n    $0\n  \n  \n    $4,000\n    $3,800\n    $200\n  \n  \n    $5,000\n    $4,600\n    $400\n  \n  \n    $6,000\n    $5,400\n    $600\n  \n  \n    $7,000\n    $6,200\n    $800\n  \n  \n    $8,000\n    $7,000\n    $1,000\n  \n  \n    $9,000\n    $7,800\n    $1,200\n  \nTable 9.1 The Consumption Function\nTo illustrate these relationships further, consider the examples in Table 9.2 and Figure 9.9.\nTable 9.2 The Consumption and Saving Functions: A Numerical Example\nFigure 9.9 The Consumption Function\nSaving\nSaving is income not spent to finance consumption. Figure 9.9 (a) shows that when income (Y) is zero, saving is \u2013 C0. In other words, households are not borrowing or selling their assets. Because just a fraction c of any change in income is spent on consumption, the remaining fraction or (1 \u2212 c) of any change in income is saved. The marginal propensity to save (MPS = \u2206S/\u2206Y) is (1 - c). Accordingly, a change in income changes planned consumption and planned saving, and MPC + MPS = 1.\nFigure 9.10 shows the saving function corresponding to the consumption function in Figure 9.9.\nFigure 9.10 The Saving Function\nBased on the above consumption function and the absence of government and foreign sectors, households can either spend income on consumption or save it. This means Y = C + S, and S = Y - C so the saving function shown in Figure 9.10 is: S = \u2212C0 + (1 \u2212 c)Y.\nAdding C = C0 + cY and S = \u2212C0 + (1 \u2212 c)Y, the left-hand side gives consumption plus saving or C + S, and the right-hand side gives income, Y = C0 + cY +( \u2212C0 + (1 \u2212 c)Y), as it should.\nLearn with videos\nMovements Along vs. Shifts in Consumption and Savings Functions\n  \n    \n    When using diagrams, we make an important distinction between events that \n      move the economy along\n     the consumption and saving functions as opposed to events that \n      shift the consumption and saving functions.\n    \n  \n \nMovement Along Consumption and Savings Functions\nA change in income causes a movement along the consumption and saving functions. The changes in consumption expenditure and saving are determined by the MPC and the MPS. These are changes in expenditure and saving plans induced by changes in income.\nShifts in Consumption and Savings Functions\nAny change other than a change in income that affects consumption and saving at every income level causes a shift in the consumption and saving functions. These changes in expenditure and saving plans are autonomous, caused by something other than changes in income.\nThe economic crisis and recession of 2008-2009 is explained in part by shifts in household consumption expenditure caused by changes in confidence and expectations about the future of the economy. Consumers watched as banks and financial institutions collapsed in many countries. Pessimism and uncertainty about households\u2019 income and finances increased with losses in household financial wealth as equity markets declined sharply on an international scale. In addition, the housing bubble collapse in the United States caused households to cut back, reducing autonomous expenditure.\nEven in relatively tranquil economic times, increases in household indebtedness, changes in demographics, or changes in government monetary and fiscal policies will change autonomous consumption and shift the consumption function.\nChanging Slopes of Consumption and Savings Functions\nWe also identify a limited number of changes in the economy that will affect the slopes of the consumption and saving functions. For instance, a change in household preferences for saving that reduces the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption. These events are of special interest because the slope of the consumption function\u2014and the household expenditure behavior it describes\u2014is the key to our understanding of fluctuations in real output.\nInvestment as a Function of National Income\nInvestment (I) decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do not depend on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.\nFigure 9.11 shows an investment function where the level of investment is set at a level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.\nFigure 9.11 The Investment Function\n- The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and it therefore does not change with the level of current national income.\n- In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.\nThe appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that affect investment\u2014new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment\u2014can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up, indicating an increase in the level of investments, or down, indicating the decrease in investments.\n  \n    Investment expenditure (I) is business expenditure on current output\n    that adds to the stock of capital used to produce current goods and\n    services.\n  \nGovernment Spending as a Function of National Income\nFigure 9.12 The Government Spending Function\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending (G) appears as a horizontal line just like the investments function. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.\n- The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300.\n- Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.\nBuilding the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function\nAll the components of aggregate expenditure\u2014consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and the trade balance (or net exports, NX, or X-M)\u2014are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. The same components also form aggregate demand, which we will explore in the next chapter.\nFigure 9.15 builds an aggregate expenditure function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text.\nFigure 9.15 A Keynesian Cross Diagram\n- Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax consumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed.\n- The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000.\n- Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.\nNational Income\nAfter-Tax Income\nConsumption\nGovernment Spending + Investment + Exports\nImports\nAggregate Expenditure\n$3,000\n$2,100\n$2,280\n$2,640\n$300\n$4,620\n$4,000\n$2,800\n$2,840\n$2,640\n$400\n$5,080\n$5,000\n$3,500\n$3,400\n$2,640\n$500\n$5,540\n$6,000\n$4,200\n$3,960\n$2,640\n$600\n$6,000\n$7,000\n$4,900\n$4,520\n$2,640\n$700\n$6,460\n$8,000\n$5,600\n$5,080\n$2,640\n$800\n$6,920\n$9,000\n$6,300\n$5,640\n$2,640\n$900\n$7,380\nTable 9.3 below shows how to bring taxes into the consumption function.\n- The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram.\n- The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes.\n- The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 \u00d7 0.8) from one row to the next.\n- The fourth column shows investment, government, spending, and exports, which do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640.\n- The fifth column shows the level of imports, which are calculated as 0.1 of real GDP in this example.\n- The final column, aggregate expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X \u2013 M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in Figure 9.15.\nThe aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking the consumption function (after taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import function on top of one another. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures, which do not vary with national income.\nThe upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function is determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, tax rate, and marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter, because out of any extra income, more goes to savings, taxes, or imports and less goes to spending on domestic goods and services.\nThe equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["aggregate expenditures", "national income", "consumption", "investment", "government spending", "exports", "consumption", "marginal propensity to consume", "incremental dollar", "vertical axis autonomous consumption", "autonomous expenditure", "video", "learning", "feedback", "customer service", "it managers", "web site", "consumption", "savings functions", "mpc", "mps", "saving plans", "investment", "expected rates of return", "economic conditions", "Keynesian cross diagram", "investment function", "government spending", "government spending function", "kennethian cross diagram", "horizontal", "combined aggregate expenditure function", "government spending", "trade balance", "net exports", "k", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "09-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the connection between trade balances and financial capital flows - Calculate\n  comparative advantage - Explain balanced trade in terms of investment and capital\n  flows\nWith the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram: equilibrium and recessionary or inflationary gaps. To address the two elements, we will first interpret the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line as equilibrium. We will then relate this point of intersection to the potential GDP line, thus defining a recessionary or inflationary gap.\nWhere Equilibrium Occurs\nEquilibrium occurs at the point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X \u2013 M crosses the 45-degree line. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production.\nThe meaning of equilibrium remains the same: a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome.\nFigure 9.16 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram\n- If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold.\n- If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending exceeds the number of goods being produced.\n- Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.\nTo understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in Figure 9.16, where output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold\u2014not a sustainable state of affairs.\nConversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L\u2014 where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.\nThus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.\nWork It Out\nFinding Equlibrium\nFigure 9.5 gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete Table 10.5 and then answer these questions:\n- What is the consumption function?\n- What is the equilibrium?\n- Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?\n- How do expenditures and output compare at this point?\n  \n    \n      National Income\n      Taxes\n      After-tax income\n      Consumption\n      I + G + X\n      Imports\n      Aggregate Expenditures\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      $300\n      \n      \n      $236\n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      $400\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      $500\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      $600\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      $700\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \nTable 9.5\nStep 1\nCalculate the amount of taxes for each level of national income (reminder: GDP = national income) using the following as an example:\nNational Income (Y) $300\nTaxes = 0.2 or 20% \u00d7 0.2\nTax amount (T) $60\nStep 2\nCalculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from national income for each level of national income using the following as an example:\nNational income minus $300\nTaxes \u2013$60\nAfter-tax income $240\nStep 3\nCalculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply by 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using the following as an example:\nAfter-tax Income $240\nMPC \u00d7 0.9\nConsumption $216\nStep 4\nConsider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first row.

That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 = $20.\nStep 5\nThere is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found by figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero.

At national income of $300, aggregate expenditures are $388.\nStep 13\nAnswer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures cannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.\nmissing Carousels\nRecessionary and Inflationary Gaps\n  \n    \n    In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects\n    the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP or at the level of production\n    at full-employment, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession,\n    and unemployment is low.\n  \n \nFigure 9.17 Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps\n- Figure 9.17 (a) illustrates a situation where the equilibrium occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP.\n- Figure 9.17 (b) illustrates a situation where the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP.\n  \n    \n    There is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level\n    of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.\n  \n \nRecessionary gap\nFigure 9.17 (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at point E0, which is a real GDP of $6,000, below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur. The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.\nWhat might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in  remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession away.\nThe appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE0 to AE1. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E1 now occurs at potential GDP as shown in Figure 9.17 (a)\nInflationary gap\nFigure 9.17 (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE0) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a na\u00efve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired, even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and market institutions.\nThe inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.\nThe appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in Figure 9.17 (b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line AE0 and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE0 shifts down to AE1, so that the new equilibrium is at E1, then the economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government expenditures.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["comparative advantage", "balanced trade", "investment", "capital flows", "Keynesian cross diagram", "gmm", "aggregate expenditure line", "total amount", "aggregate demand", "real output", "kenn", "qulibrium", "Keynesian model", "national income", "investment", "government spending", "exports", "inflationary gaps", "Keynesian cross diagram", "aggregate expenditure line", "45", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "09-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Define the Macroeconomic Multiplier and Explain How It Works - Calculate the\n  Multiplier - Calculate the Effect of Policy Interventions - Assess Tradeoffs of\n  Policy Interventions\nThe Keynesian expenditure-output or Keynesian cross diagram model has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of $700, while the level of potential GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP?\nThe obvious answer might be $800 \u2013 $700 = $100; therefore, to reach equilibrium, we need to raise government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a change in aggregate expenditures circles throughout the economy: Households buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers, and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is called the multiplier effect: An initial increase in spending cycles repeatedly throughout the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.\nHow Does the Multiplier Work?\nTo understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment, or potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced goods and services.\nAs shown in the calculations in Figure 9.18 and Table 9.7, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in Figure 9.18, so that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $28.09).\nFigure 9.18 The Multiplier Effect\n- An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate expenditure of $100.\n- But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others.\n- Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets smaller and smaller.\n- Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.\n  \n    Original increase in aggregate expenditure from government spending\n    100\n  \n  \n    \n      Which is income to people throughout the economy: Pay 30% in taxes.

Figure 10.18 shows these total aggregate expenditures after the first four rounds and then the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each round of consumption.\nAfter about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed\u2014nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.\nLearn with Videos\nCalculating the Multiplier\nFortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the impact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for calculating the multiplier.\nAccording to Figure 9.18 and Table 9.7:\n  Spending Multiplier = 1/(1 \u2013 MPC * (1 \u2013 tax rate) + MPI)\n- Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%\n- Tax rate = 10%\n- Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%\nThe MPC is equal to 1 \u2013 MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:\n  \n    \n      Spending Multiplier = 1 / 1 \u2013 (0.7 \u2013 (0.10)(0.7) \u2013 0.10)\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        = 1 / 0.47\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        = 2.13\n      \n    \n  \nA change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of $213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in Figure 10.18 after many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.\n  \n    The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal\n    dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports.\n  \nThese three factors are known as leakages, because they determine how much demand \u201cleaks out\u201d in each round of the multiplier effect:\n- If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high.\n- Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second, third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small.\nChanges in the size of the leakages\u2014a change in the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import\u2014will change the size of the multiplier.\nLearn with Videos\nCalculating Keynesian Policy Interventions\nReturning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as Figure 9.19 shows.\nFigure 9.19 The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model\n1. The power of the multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical increase from AE0 to AE1.\n2. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.\nThe multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure 9.19 shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, and the slope of the aggregate expenditure function (AE0), determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE1, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to reach potential GDP.\nNow, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100. The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. Similarly, if you look back at Figure 9.18, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis\u2014the multiplier effect at work. In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income\u2013expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic calculation.\nThe multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any spending change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures and will have an even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.\nClear It Up\nHow can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?\nAttracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent article, \u201cPublic Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,\u201d James Joyner of Outside the Beltway looked at public financing for NFL teams. Joyner\u2019s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let\u2019s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let\u2019s assume that they save one-third of their after-tax income.\nHowever, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let\u2019s say that one-half of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.\nNow, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional athletes, so let\u2019s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher proportion of their income on local goods\u2014say, 65%.\nIf these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is recycled into the local economy.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet search for \u201ceconomic impact of sports\u201d will yield numerous reports questioning this economic development strategy.\nMultiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy\nIs an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.\nHowever, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["michaelis", "macroeconomic multiplier", "policy interventions", "Keynes", "multiplier work", "Keynesian cross diagram", "real gdp", "after", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "spending multiplier", "Marginal propensity to save", "30", "maxis", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "korea", "government spending", "aggregate demand", "tax", "saving", "import rates", "professional sports", "building sports stadiums", "economic development strategy", "public financing", "private sports stadiums", "multiplier tradeoffs", "stability", "high multiplier", "low multiplier", "aggregate demand", "government", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain Say's Law and understand why it primarily applies in the long run - Explain\n  Keynes' Law and understand why it primarily applies in the short run\nMacroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups:\nThose who argue that supply is the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along.\nThose who argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags along.\nSay's Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply\n  \n    \n    \u201dSupply creates its own demand.\u201c\n  \n  \n    \n    - Jean-Baptiste Say, French Economist (1767-1832)\n  \n \nThose economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous early nineteenth century French economist named Jean-Baptiste Say (1767\u20131832).

The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone, and Say\u2019s law argues that a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy.\nIf supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.\nSay's law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their products.\n  \n    \n      Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and other economists writing about\n      this view around the turn of the nineteenth century were known as\n      \u201cclassical\u201d economists, modern economists who generally subscribe to Say\u2019s\n      law are called neoclassical economists. They focus on the importance of\n      supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy.\n    \n  \nKeynes' Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand\n  \n    \n    \u201dDemand creates its own supply.\u201c\n  \n  \n    \n    -John Maynard Keynes\n  \n \nThe alternative to Say's law, with its emphasis on supply, is Keynes' law: \u201cDemand creates its own supply.\u201d Just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say\u2019s law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes\u2019 law, but it is a useful simplification that conveys a certain way of understanding the macroeconomy.\nWhen Keynes wrote his influential work The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money during the 1930s, he pointed out that the economy's capacity to supply goods and services had not changed much during the Great Depression. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s.\nThus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression\u2014and many ordinary recessions as well\u2014were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the amount of total demand.\nKeynes\u2019 law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in government spending or by legislating large tax cuts to push up consumption.\n  \n    \n      Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce,\n      limits determined by the quantity of labor, physical capital, technology,\n      and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of\n      production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at\n      the macroeconomic level do not disappear just because of an increase in\n      demand.\n    \n  \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monte carlo", "says law", "macroeconomy", "demand", "says law", "macroeconomics", "supply", "demand", "individual markets", "gdp", "keynes law", "macroeconomics", "demand", "physical capital", "technology", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real GDP and potential\n  GDP - Explain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by price levels\n  - Interpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model - Identify the point of\n  equilibrium in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model - Define short run aggregate\n  supply and long run aggregate supply\n  \n    \n    To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines\n    total supply or total demand for the economy and how the two interact at the\n    macroeconomic level.\n  \n \nWe call this the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.\nThe Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP\nFirms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, that they need to buy.\n  \n    Aggregate supply (AS)  refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell.\n    The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and sell at each price level.\n  \nFigure 10.2 shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.\nFigure 10.2 The Aggregate Supply Curve\nAggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.\nThe diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP\u2014that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In other words, the price level in the AD/AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in The Macroeconomic Perspective. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. We visualize the price level as an index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price level over time.\nAs the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price level on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or outputs bought in the economy\u2014i.e. the GDP deflator\u2014not the price level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an increase in aggregate demand.\nAn AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP, which we define as the amount of real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell\u2014while assuming no rise in input prices\u2014can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.\nAs the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the AS curve's intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to encourage a greater quantity of output\u2014but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)\nLearn with Videos\nClear It Up\nWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\nEconomists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling:\n  \n    \n    How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its \u201cpotential\u201d\n    or \u201cfull employment\u201d GDP?\n  \n \nThe economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.\nAt the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are fully employed. In Figure 10.2, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called full-employment GDP.\nDefining SRAS and LRAS\nThe AS curve shows short run changes in aggregate supply, while the vertical line at potential GDP shows long run changes in aggregate supply. In the short run, if demand is too low or too high, it is possible for producers to supply less or more than potential GDP. In the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.\nLearn with Videos\nThe Aggregate Demand Curve\nAggregate demand (AD) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We explained this distinction in the previous chapter on The Expenditure-Output Model. For now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.\nAggregate demand includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the price level\u2014recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level.\nFigure 10.3 The Aggregate Demand Curve\nFigure 10.3 presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level.\nThe AD curve slopes down, which means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand:\n- consumption spending (C)\n- investment spending (I)\n- government spending (G)\n- spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X \u2013 M.\n  \n    \n      Wealth Effect\n    \n    \n      The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the\n      buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts and\n      other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation.\n      Because a rise in the price level reduces people\u2019s wealth, consumption\n      spending will fall as the price level rises.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Interest Rate Effect\n    \n    \n      The interest rate effect holds that as prices for outputs rise, the\n      same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This\n      additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In\n      turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for\n      investment purposes and reduce borrowing by households for homes and\n      cars\u2014thus reducing consumption and investment spending.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Foreign Price Effect\n    \n    \n      The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United\n      States while remaining fixed in other countries, then goods in the United\n      States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of\n      the world. U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive, and the\n      quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. imports from abroad will be\n      relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher\n      domestic price level, relative to price levels in other countries, will\n      reduce net export expenditures.\n    \n  \nAmong economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in Figure 10.3 slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not very large.\nRead the following Work It Out feature to learn how to interpret the AD/AS model. In this example, aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level are given for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\nWork It Out\nInterpreting the AD/AS Model\nTable 10.1 shows the information on aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\n  \n    \n    What information does Table 10.1 tell you about the state of the Xurbia\u2019s economy?\n    Where is the equilibrium price level and output level (this is the SR macroequilibrium)?\n    Is Xurbia risking inflationary pressures or facing high unemployment?

What is the equilibrium?\nFigure 10.4 The AD/AS Curves AD and AS curves created from the data in Table 10.1.\nStep 1: Draw your x- and y-axis. Label the x-axis Real GDP and the y-axis Price Level.\nStep 2: Plot AD on your graph.\nStep 3: Plot AS on your graph.\nStep 4: Look at Figure 10.4 which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.\nStep 5: Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium with the price level at 130 and real GDP at $680.\nStep 6: Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the AS curve becomes quite steep, almost vertical, which seems to start at about$750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are likely to be small.\nStep 7: Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential GDP.\nStep 8: Draw conclusions from the given information:\n- If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then the economy is not close to potential GDP. It will be experiencing unemployment, but have stable price levels.\n- If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP. It will be experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.\nLearn with Videos\nEquilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nThe intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price level rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.\nFigure 10.5 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand\nFigure 10.5 combines the AS curve from Figure 10.2 and the AD curve from Figure 10.3 and places them both on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\nConfusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.\nClear It Up\nAre AS and AD macro or micro?\nThe aggregate supply/demand model has a superficial resemblance to the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital, but the two approaches also have many underlying differences.\n1. The vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared with the prices of other products, e.g. the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken. In contrast, the vertical axis of an aggregate supply/aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator, combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is the average price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a specific market.\n2. The economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram, as we shall see in later chapters, though, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the AS curve.\nIn short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.\nDefining SRAS and LRAS\nIn the Clear It Up feature titled \u201cWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\u201d we differentiated between short run changes in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in aggregate supply which the vertical line at potential GDP defines. In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["aggregate supply model", "macroeconomic model", "aggregate demand curve", "real gdp", "aggregate supply curve", "potential gb", "profits", "inputs", "raw materials", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "aggregate supply curve", "potential gb", "output level", "economic intuition", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "aggregate demand curve", "total spending", "domestic goods", "services", "economy", "total planned", "adas model", "table 101", "aggregate supply", "aggregate demand", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "aggregate supply", "real gdp", "equilibrium price level", "firms", "price level", "aggregate supplydemand model", "microeconomic analysis", "demand", "supply diagram", "asym", "clear it up feature", "as cross potential gb", "short", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply curve - Explain\n  how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply curve\nThe original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts. When the AS curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers supply a greater quantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower quantity of real GDP.\nThis module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve: productivity growth and changes in input prices.\nHow Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve\n  \n  \n    \n       In the long run, the most important factor that shifts the aggregate curve is productivity growth.\n    \n  \nProductivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker, or GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output.\nHistorically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level.\nFigure 10.6 (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS0 to SRAS1 to SRAS2, and the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2. Note that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP. Thus, full employment corresponds to a higher level of potential GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS0 to LRAS1 to LRAS2.\nFigure 10.6 Shifts in Aggregate Supply\n(a) The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium, E1, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2. Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level.\n(b) A higher price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real GDP will be produced so AS will shift to the left from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).\nA shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how in Choice in a World of Scarcity, we said that a nation's production possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in the long run? This is the same phenomenon using a different model.\nHow Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve\nHigher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits. Figure 10.6 (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, causing the equilibrium to move from E0 to E1.\nFigure 10.6 Shifts in Aggregate Supply\nThe movement from the original equilibrium of E0 to the new equilibrium of E1 will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974\u20131975, 1980\u20131982, 1990\u201391, 2001, and 2007\u20132009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation.\nConversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting oil price led to a situation like that of Figure 10.6 (a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.\nAlong with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left. Note that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only SRAS.\n  \n    Increases in the price of inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left\n    Decreases in the price of inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the right\n  \nOther Supply Shocks\nThe aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor.\nFor example, an unexpected early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.\nSimilarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply.\nAn extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their country. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to produce goods at any given price.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["productivity growth", "aggregate supply curve", "input prices", "adas diagram", "productivity growth", "as curve", "gdp", "uk", "advanced economy", "input prices", "macroeconomic impact", "aggregate supply", "energy products", "ras", "aggregate supply curve", "shocks", "input goods", "labor", "agricultural crops", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain how imports influence aggregate demand - Identify ways in which business\n  confidence and consumer confidence can affect aggregate demand - Explain how government\n  policy can change aggregate demand - Evaluate why economists disagree on the topic\n  of tax cuts\nAs we have mentioned, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M).\nA shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level. The Keynesian Perspective will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift: changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government tax or spending policy.\nRead the following Clear It Up feature for an explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.\nClear It Up\nDo imports diminish aggregate demand?\nWe have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand? The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as total demand for domestically produced goods and services.\nWhen an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. Thus, the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country. It would be wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.\n  \n    \n      Because of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is easy to\n      make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for the economy. Just\n      keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding\n      positive number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.\n    \n  \nHow Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD\n  \n    \n    When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend\n    to consume more. If business confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more\n    on investment, believing that the future payoff from that investment will be\n    substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption\n    and investment spending decline.\n  \n \nThe University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at Surveys of Consumers, which breaks down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has climbed from a low of 55.8 in 2011 back to a level in the low 80s, which economists consider close to a healthy state.\nThe Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) publishes one measure of business confidence: the \"business tendency surveys\". The OECD collects business opinion survey data for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment, among other business climate elements. After sharply declining during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the past.\nFigure 10.7 Shifts in Aggregate Demand\n(a) An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right.\n(b) A decrease in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.\nBecause economists associate a rise in confidence with higher consumption and investment demand, higher confidence will lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as Figure 10.7 (a) shows.\nConsumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities. For example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left. In a self-fulfilling prophecy, such rhetoric might actually cause the recession that the President warned against in the first place. Figure 10.7 (b) shows a shift of AD to the left, and the corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price level.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for data on consumer sentiment.\n    \n  \nHow Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD\nGovernment spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in Figure 10.7 (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in Figure 10.7 (b).\nIn the United States, for example, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of GDP in 1991, to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion.\nTax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.\nDuring a recession, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses, the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress passed a tax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need relief from taxes.\nThe aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as Figure 10.8 illustrates. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E0, relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the right. At the new equilibrium (E1), real GDP rises, and unemployment falls. Because in this diagram, the economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains muted.\nFigure 10.8 Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model\nWhether the economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical LRAS line.\nIn this example, the level of output Y0 at the equilibrium E0 is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP.\nIn contrast, the level of output Y1 at the equilibrium E1 is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.\nRead the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.\nClear It Up\nDo economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?\nOne of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: \u201cRead my lips\n  \n    \n    What side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them?\n    The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides, is that it depends.\n  \n \n1. One issue is whether equally large government spending cuts accompany the tax cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be and what programs the government might cut back.\n2. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close the economy is to the full employment output level. In a recession, when the AD and AS curves intersect far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.\nWith the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001 Bush tax cuts and the 2009 Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor tax cuts during recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.\nHere, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve's relatively flat or relatively steep portion.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["aggregate demand", "consumer confidence", "government policy", "consumption spending", "investment spending", "government spending", "aggregate demand", "total demand", "domestically produced goods", "services", "income", "domestic demand", "consumer confidence", "business confidence", "investment spending", "university of michicago", "surveys of", "government macroeconomic policy choices", "government spending", "aggregate supply", "aggregate demand framework", "u", "tax cuts", "american politics", "economic policy", "gdp", "full employment", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Use the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model to show periods of economic growth\n  and recession - Explain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate demand/aggregate\n  supply model - Evaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate supply\n  model\nThe AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals of growth, unemployment, and low inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both Keynes\u2019 law, which focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, and Say\u2019s law, which focuses on aggregate supply and the long run.\nThese advantages of the AD/AS model are considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.\nGrowth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram\nIn the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the full employment level of GDP) will gradually shift to the right over time as well.\nFigure 10.7 Shifts in Aggregate Supply\nEarlier, Figure 10.7 (a) showed a pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year. However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate\u2014like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth\u2014do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.\nFigure 10.9 Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model\nIn the short run, GDP falls and rises as every economy dips into or expands out of recession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E0 in Figure 10.9. From another standpoint, in years of resurgent economic growth, the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E1 in Figure 11.9 shows.\nUnemployment in the AD/AS Diagram\nThe AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP employment level. Returning to Figure 10.9, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E1. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E0. Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.\nInflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram\nInflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms. The biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century, for example, followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II.\nConversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative\u2014a situation called \u201cdeflation\u201d\u2014during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007\u20132009, the inflation rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to \u20130.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid\u20131980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend of being substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1\u20135% range annually.\nThe AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. In Figure 10.10 (a), aggregate demand shifts to the right. The new equilibrium E1 is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E0. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed. In this case, additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.\nFigure 10.10 Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model\n(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium.\n(b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).\nAn alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy\u2014perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor. These higher price levels cause the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In Figure 10.10 (b), the SRAS curve's shift to the left also increases the price level from P0 at the original equilibrium (E0) to a higher price level of P1 at the new equilibrium (E1). In effect, the rise in input prices results in a higher price level for outputs after the final output is produced and sold.\nThe AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these expectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation expected.\nThese two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.\nImportance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\n- Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts, including:\n- The three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment\n- The four elements of aggregate demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports\n- Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs\n- Economic events and policy decisions that can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["aggregate supply model", "recession", "macroeconomic goals", "growth", "unemployment", "growth", "recession", "adas diagram diagram", "longrun economic growth", "inflationary pressure", "adas", "economic booms", "war", "world war", "aggregate demand", "aggregate supply", "macroeconomics", "macroeconomic goals", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "10-06": {"text": "Bring It Home\nFrom Housing Bubble to Housing Bust\nWe can explain economic fluctuations, whether those experienced during the 1930s Great Depression, the 1970s stagflation, or the 2008-2009 Great Recession, using the AD/AS diagram. Short-run fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD curve, or both.\nIn the case of the housing bubble, rising home values caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values continued to rise, the increased value would pay off any debt outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and economic growth in the United States.\nWhen the housing bubble burst, overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This drop in home values was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its contagion into the financial market that essentially locked up new credit. The AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the Great Recession's rising unemployment.\n  \n    \n    Understanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided monetary\n    and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions to take to mitigate\n    the impact of the housing crisis.\n  \n \nFrom a monetary policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts, and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.\nWhile most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations. We discuss the possible policy actions and the differences among economists about their effectiveness in more detail in The Keynesian Perspective, Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation, and Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["housing bubble", "economic fluctuations", "adas diagram", "home equity loans", "economic growth", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "11-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps - Recognize the Keynesian\n  AD/AS model - Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure\n  and investment expenditure - Analyze the factors that determine government spending\n  and net exports\nThe Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand and argues that firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation\u2019s potential GDP, the amount of goods and services that actually sell, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists across the economy. Figure 11.2 illustrates this point.\nFigure 11.2 The Keynesian AD/AS Model\nThe Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\nKeynes argued that aggregate demand is not stable\u2014that it can change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P0 and Yp. Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment, as Y1 in Figure 11.2 shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.\nIn the same way, if AD increases, the economy could experience an inflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output.\nWhat Determines Consumption Expenditure?\nWe call spending on new capital goods investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:\n1. Producer\u2019s durable equipment and software\n2. Changes in inventories\n3. Nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations)\n4. Residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings)\nBusinesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the last.\nKeynes\u2019s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both the expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).\nThe clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits. When we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.\nInterest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, businesses need financing when they purchase big-ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.\nMany factors can affect the expected profitability of an investment. For example, if energy prices decline, then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If the government offers special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if the government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand.\nWhat Determines Investment Expenditure?\nConsumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries\u2014once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.\nKeynes identified three factors that affect consumption:\n  \n    \n      Disposable income\n    \n    \n      For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they\n      consume is how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as\n      disposable income, which is income after taxes.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Expected future income\n    \n    \n      Consumer expectations about future income also are important in\n      determining consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future,\n      they are more likely to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News\n      of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on\n      consumption.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Wealth\n    \n    \n      When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to\n      consume a higher share of their income and to save less. When the U.S.\n      stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for example, U.S.\n      savings rates declined, probably in part because people felt that their\n      wealth had increased and there was less need to save. People spend beyond\n      their income by borrowing when they perceive their wealth increasing. On\n      the other hand, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40% from March\n      2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their\n      economic future, so savings rates increased while consumption declined.\n    \n  \nFinally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the right.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for more information about how the recession affected various groups of people.\n    \n  \nWhat Determines Government Spending?\nThe third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities and Positive Externalities and Public Goods, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.\nKeynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or raising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending.\n  \n    Keynes concluded that during extreme times like deep recessions, only the\n    government had the power and resources to move aggregate demand.\n  \nWhat Determines Net Exports?\nRecall that exports are domestically produced products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.\nTwo sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand:\n1. changes in relative growth rates between countries\n2. changes in related prices between countries\nWhat happens in the economies of the countries that would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example, if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the level of income in the domestic economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: More income will bring a higher level of imports.\nRelative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S. goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.\nTable 11.1 summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand.\n  \n    Reasons for a Decrease in Aggregate Demand\n    Reasons for an Increase in Aggregate Demand\n  \n  \n    *Consumption*- Rise in taxes\n    \n  \n  \n    - Fall in income\n    \n  \n  \n    - Rise in interest rates\n    \n  \n  \n    - Desire to save more\n    \n  \n  \n    - Decrease in wealth\n    \n  \n  \n    - Fall in future expected income\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    *Consumption*- Decrease in taxes\n  \n  \n    - Increase in income\n    \n  \n  \n    - Fall in interest rates\n    \n  \n  \n    - Desire to save less\n    \n  \n  \n    - Rise in wealth\n    \n  \n  \n    - Rise in future expected income\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    *Investment*- Fall in expected rate of return\n    \n  \n  \n    - Rise in interest rates\n    \n  \n  \n    - Drop in business confidence\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    *Investment*- Rise in expected rate of return\n  \n  \n    - Drop in interest rates\n    \n  \n  \n    - Rise in business confidence\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    *Government*- Reduction in government spending\n    \n  \n  \n    - Increase in taxes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    *Government*- Increase in government spending\n  \n  \n    - Decrease in taxes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    *Net Exports*- Decrease in foreign demand\n    \n  \n  \n    - Relative price increase of U.S. goods\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    *Net Exports*- Increase in foreign demand\n  \n  \n    - Relative price drop of U.S. goods\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \nTable 11.1 Determinants of Aggregate Demand\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["kleynesian adas model", "investment expenditure", "aggregate demand", "consumption expenditure", "capital goods investment expenditure", "nonresidential structures", "singlefamily homes", "consumption expenditure", "households", "individuals", "durable goods", "nondurable goods", "services", "government spending", "aggregate demand", "federal", "state", "local government spending", "united states", "net exports", "domestic goods", "services", "import expenditures", "relative growth rates", "countries", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "11-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky\n  wages and prices and the importance of aggregate demand - Explain the coordination\n  argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality - Analyze the impact of the\n  expenditure multiplier\nNow that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS).

The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks:\n1. Aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment.\n2. The macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices, which are wages and prices that do not respond quickly to decreases or increases in demand.\nWe will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are represented in the AD/AS model.\nThe Keynesian View of Recessions\nThe first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with full employment.\nSuppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or suppose the housing market collapses, as in 2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling. This will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease investment expenditure.\nThis seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929\u2014and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what happened in 2008.\n  \n    \n    As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say's law that\n    \u201csupply creates its own demand.\u201d Although production capacity existed, the markets\n    were not able to sell their products. As a result, real GDP was less than potential\n    GDP.\n  \n \n  \n  \n    \n    Visit FRED Research Economic Data for raw data used to calculate GDP.\n    \n  \nWage and Price Stickiness\nKeynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are \u201csticky,\u201d making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP.\nKeynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the coordination argument. This argument points out that, even if, hypothetically, most people would be willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions. The chapter on Unemployment proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.\nSome modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky, too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two sets of costs:\n1. Changing prices uses company resources: managers must analyze the competition and market demand, decide new prices, update sales materials, change billing records, and redo product and price labels.\n2. Frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry\u2014especially if they discover that a product now costs more than they expected. These costs of changing prices are called menu costs\u2014like the costs of printing a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant.\n   Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.\nTo understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider Figure 11.3 (a), which illustrates the overall labor market. Figure 11.3 (b), on the other hand, illustrates a market for a specific good or service.\nThe original equilibrium (E0) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D0) and supply curve (S0). When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 11.3 (a) and the demand for goods shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 11.3 (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the wage remains at its original level (W0) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P0).\nAs a result, a situation of excess supply\u2014where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or price\u2014exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q1 is less than Q0 in both Figure 11.3 (a) and Figure 11.3 (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage.\nThe Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.\nFigure 11.3 Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods Market\nIn both (a) and (b), demand shifts left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1.\nSimilarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.\nClear It Up\nWhy Is the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?\nThe recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a larger trend in job growth and pay in the post\u2013recession recovery.\nFigure 11.4 Jobs Lost/Gained in the Recession/Recovery\nData in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggests that jobs lost were in mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage occupations.\nThe National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. Figure 11.4 illustrates this data.\nWages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly \u201csticky.\u201d Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012, pushing real wages down.\nLearn with Videos\nThe Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model\nFigure 11.5 is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates the two building blocks of the Keynesian perspective: the importance of aggregate demand in causing a recession, and the stickiness of wages and prices.\nNote that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either labor or specific good supply. In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as Figure 11.5 shows.\nFigure 11.5 A Keynesian Perspective of Recession\nThis figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD0 to AD1. The recession persists because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were not the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E1 occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.\nThis outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding, which we would show as a movement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level.\nThe original equilibrium of the economy in Figure 11.5 occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD0) intersects with AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y1, the economy experiences substantial unemployment.\nThe Expenditure Multiplier\nA key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.\nThe reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person's spending becomes another person's income, which leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. The appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model provides the details of the multiplier process, but the concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["keynesian economics", "policy prescription", "firms", "full employment", "ad", "kennethian diagnosis", "aggregate supply", "aggregate demand", "household wealth", "consumption", "stabilized wages", "ad fluctuated", "coordination argument", "marketoriented", "wages", "recovery", "united states", "lowwage workers", "hamburg", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "kuttaian assumption", "adas model", "diagram", "aggregate demand", "korea", "koreaian economics", "expenditure multiplier", "equilibrium level", "g", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "11-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the Phillips curve, noting its impact on the theories of Keynesian economics\n  - Graph a Phillips curve - Identify factors that cause the instability of the Phillips\n  curve - Analyze the Keynesian policy for reducing unemployment and inflation\nThe simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes's original model. More recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than the right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far below potential (\u201cthe Keynesian zone\u201d), very steep at levels of output above potential (\u201cthe neoclassical zone\u201d) and curved in between (\u201cthe intermediate zone\u201d). Figure 11.6 illustrates this. The typical aggregate supply curve leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.\nFigure 11.6 Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve\n  \n    Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zon at the SRAS curve's far\n    left, small shifts in AD to the right or the left will affect the output\n    level Yk, but will not affect the price level by much.

Phillips, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession, inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and found a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, which became known as the Phillips curve. Figure 11.7 shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.\nFigure 12.7 A Keynesian Phillips Curve Tradeoff between Unemployment and Inflation\nA Phillips curve illustrates a tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. If one is higher, the other must be lower. For example, point A illustrates a 5% inflation rate and a 4% unemployment. If the government attempts to reduce inflation to 2%, then it will experience a rise in unemployment to 7%, as point B shows.\nWork It Out\nmissing Carousels\nThe Phillips Curve for the United States\nStep 1.

Your graph should look like the figure above that shows the negative relationship between employment and inflation.\nStep 10.\nPlot the Phillips curve for 1960\u20131979. What does the graph look like? Do you still see the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment? Your graph should look like the figure above that shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation appeared to break down during the 1970s as the Phillips Curve shifted out to the right.\nOver this longer period, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted out. There is no longer a tradeoff.\nThe Instability of the Phillips Curve\nDuring the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation and high unemployment, high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Economies could use fiscal and monetary policy to move up and down the Phillips curve up or down as desired.\nThen a curious thing happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result was an increase in both inflation and unemployment. The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation. What had happened? The Phillips curve had shifted.\nThis pattern became known as stagflation. Recall from The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation. Perhaps most importantly, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional Keynesian economics could not explain.\nEconomists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift:\n1. Supply shocks\n    Like the mid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary.\n2. Changes in inflationary expectations\n    In other words, there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears.\nBoth supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus the Phillips curve, to shift.\nIn short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve as valid for short-run periods of several years, but over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that unemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early 1990s or first decade of the 2000s).\nLearn with Videos\nKeynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation\nKeynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in Figure 11.8, so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.\nFigure 11.8 Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian Policy\nIf an economy is in recession, with an equilibrium at Er, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr toward ADf.\nIf an economy is experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy response to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf.\nKeynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads, and other amenities, if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical ways, then it might spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a modern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money underground and let mining companies start digging up the money again.\nThese suggestions were slightly tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP.\nThe other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left. The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment.\nIf aggregate demand was originally at ADi in Figure 11.8, so that the economy was experiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for the government to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while the economy remains at full employment.\n  \n    \n    In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment\n    and too much brings inflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as\n    pursuing a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d level of aggregate demand: not too much, not too little,\n    but just right.\n  \n \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["ph", "japanese economics", "Phillips curve", "aggregate supply curve", "real", "Phillips curve", "kennethian analytical framework", "inflationary pressures", "Phillips curve", "united states", "consumer price indexes", "xls option", "phill curve", "policy menu", "low inflation", "high inflation", "low unemployment", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "keynesian policy", "recession", "inflation", "macroeconomics", "tax cuts", "investment", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "11-04": {"text": "Learn with Videos\nBring It Home\nThe Great Recession\nThe lessons learned during the 1930s Great Depression and the aggregate expenditure model that John Maynard Keynes proposed gave the economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate the treacherous economy of the latter half of the 2000s.\nIn \u201cHow the Great Recession Was Brought to an End\", Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi wrote that the actions taken by today\u2019s policymakers stand in sharp contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression. Today\u2019s economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax rebates to \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment.\nAlthough these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "gutta", "great recession", "aggregate expenditure model", "federal reserve", "shortterm", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "12-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the importance of potential GDP in the long run - Analyze the role of\n  flexible prices - Interpret a neoclassical model of aggregate demand and aggregate\n  supply - Evaluate different ways for measuring the speed of macroeconomic adjustment\nThis chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics:\n1. Potential GDP determines the economy's size\n2. Wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output.\nThe key policy implication in the neoclassical model is that government should focus more on long-term growth and controlling inflation than worry about recessions or cyclical unemployment. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis, while Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run.\nLet's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can apply them in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.\n  \n    The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that, in the long run,\n    the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of\n    unemployment.\n  \nThe Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run\n  \n    \n    When economists refer to \u201cpotential GDP\u201d they are referring to the level of output\n    that an economy can achieve when all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial\n    ability) are fully employed.\n  \n \nOver the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to \u201cpotential GDP\u201d they are referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, economists say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or at full employment.\nEconomists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing. As explained in Economic Growth, we can explain GDP growth by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology.\nPhysical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products.\nThese two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.\nTo see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college degree. The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown dramatically.\nThe technology available to modern workers is extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care\u2014the list of technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.\nOver time the GDP has fallen below its potential level and, at times, has exceeded it. For example, from 2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential GDP to this day. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at its potential GDP\u2014or even slightly ahead.\nFigure 12.1 Potential and Actual GDP (in 2009 Dollars)\nActual GDP falls below potential GDP during and after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981\u201382, 1990\u201391, 2001, and 2008\u20132009 and continues below potential GDP through 2016. In other cases, actual GDP can be above potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.\nFigure 12.1 shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1\u20133% below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.\nFigure 12.2 A Vertical AS Curve\nIn the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is located at potential GDP\u2014that is, we draw the LRAS curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 12.2 shows.\nA vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply (or potential GDP) will determine the economy's real GDP, regardless of the level of aggregate demand. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists often describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a nation's long-term economic growth.\nLearn with Videos\nThe Role of Flexible Prices\n  \n    \n    How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long\n    run?\n  \n  \n    \n    What if aggregate demand increases or decreases?\n  \n \nEconomists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts on the fact that even if wages and prices are slow to change (\u201csticky\u201d) in the short run, they are flexible over time. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.\nThe aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in Figure 12.3 shows two aggregate supply curves. We draw the original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS0) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD0, so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E0, at which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.\nFigure 12.3 The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD Increases\nThe original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.\nNow, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium at point E1 with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.\nIn the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours. This high demand for labor will drive up wages.\nMost employers review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS1, because the price of a major input to production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E2). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E0), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.\nThis description of the short-run shift from E0 to E1 and the long-run shift from E1 to E2 is a step-by-step way of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.\nFigure 12.4 A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand\nThe original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of 110.\nThe rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand. Figure 12.4 again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS0 showing the original upward sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate demand\u2014for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads to less consumption and more saving\u2014causes the original aggregate demand curve AD0 to shift back to AD1. The shift from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) results in a decline in output. The economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises.\nWhile a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen occasionally during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower price level in the AD\u2013AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines this economy's real GDP.\nFrom the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down on pay increases\u2014or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian AS curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS0 to SRAS1).\nThe overall impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2, is that the level of output returns to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on unemployment\u2014but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply determine real GDP's size.\nHow Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?\n  \n    \n    How long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to\n    rebound to its potential GDP?\n  \n \nThis subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to John Maynard Keynes' immortal words, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy.\nOne subset of neoclassical economists holds that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid. The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.\nTo understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home values in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will build a local park or a library in that neighborhood.\nThe theory of rational expectations points out that even though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust immediately.\nAt a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading\u2014toward a change in the price level\u2014and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way and then the other.\nThe theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations: they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.\nThe empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. The speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["nash", "flexible prices", "neoclassical model", "aggregate demand", "aggregate", "potential gb", "economic growth", "human capital", "GPS technology", "universal product codes", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "fractional equations", "macroeconomy", "potential gdp", "aggregate supply diagram", "upward", "rational expectations", "economic adjustments", "real estate market", "home prices", "aggregate supply", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "12-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Discuss why and how economists measure inflation expectations - Analyze the impacts\n  of fiscal and monetary policy on aggregate supply and aggregate demand - Explain\n  the neoclassical Phillips curve, noting its tradeoff between inflation and unemployment\n  - Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics\nTo understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian perspective. Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?\nKeynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the government's ability to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring\u2014and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later.\nMoreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations may determine the amount of tax or spending changes, but the economy will take even more months to put changes in aggregate demand through spending and production into effect.\nWhen economists and policy makers consider all of these time lags and political realities, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy activates, the recession will likely be over, and the only result of government intervention will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them. Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nClear It Up\nWhy and how do economists measure inflation expectations?\nPeople take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an expected inflation factor.\nExpected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices and decreasing aggregate supply. In either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect inflation to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower interest rates, in the short run.\nBy monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows economists to predict the direction of real interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about financing investments.\nExpectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank measures, inflation expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of Economic Research continued the survey.\nCurrent Federal Reserve research compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the results, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few decades. Economists are actively researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables form and change.\n  \n  \n    \n   Visit this website to read \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Economic Commentary: A New Approach to Gauging Inflation Expectations\u201d by Joseph G. Haubrich for more information about how economists forecast expected inflation.\n    \n  \nThe Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff\nThe Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve. The short-run upward-sloping AS curve implies a downward-sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run.\nBy contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Figure 12.5 (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria at three different price levels. At every point along the vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same. Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve in Figure 12.5 (b) is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment at any level of inflation. Read the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and unemployment rates.\nFigure 12.5 From a Long-Run AS Curve to a Long-Run Phillips Curve\n(a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of unemployment.\n(b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is, regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.\nWork It Out\nTracking Inflation and Unemployment Rates\nSuppose that you have collected data for years on inflation and unemployment rates and recorded them in a table, such as Table 12.1. How do you interpret that information?\n  \n    \n      \n        Year\n      \n      \n        Inflation Rate\n      \n      \n        Unemployment Rate\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1970\n      2%\n      4%\n    \n    \n      1975\n      3%\n      3%\n    \n    \n      1980\n      2%\n      4%\n    \n    \n      1985\n      1%\n      6%\n    \n    \n      1990\n      1%\n      4%\n    \n    \n      1995\n      4%\n      2%\n    \n    \n      2000\n      5%\n      4%\n    \n  \nTable 12.1 Inflation and Unemployment Rates (1970-2000)\nFigure 12.6 Inflation and Unemployment Rates\nStep 1: Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to Figure 12.6.\nStep 2: What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.\nStep 3: Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the graph, notice that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that the economy appears to adjust back after an apparent change in the economy.\nAn example of this occurred in 1975, when the economy appeared to have an increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985, the economy looked to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.\nStep 4: Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural rate of unemployment.\nThe unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment (Figure 12.5 (a) and (b)). A small inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD1 will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD2. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation.\nThe great economist Milton Friedman (1912\u20132006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech:\n  \n  \"T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there\n  is no permanent trade-off.\"\n  \n  Milton Friedman (1912\u20132006)\nIn the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary determinant of changes in the price level.\nLearn with Videos\n  \n  \n    \n    Read an article, (Lack of) Inflation Killed the Tapper, to learn about the effects of economic intervention.\n    \n  \nFighting Unemployment or Inflation?\nAs we explained in Unemployment, economists divide unemployment into two categories, cyclical and natural, which, in turn, is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment.\n1. Cyclical Unemployment\n2. Structural Unemployment\n3. Frictional Unemployment\nCyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP, giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero.\nBecause of labor market dynamics, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment.\nMost economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a \u201cbad\u201d thing. After all, there will always be workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.\nThe neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the cyclical unemployment problem\u2014that is, unemployment caused by recession\u2014while putting more attention on the unemployment rate issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to reduce the natural rate of unemployment.\nSuch policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed), economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek employment.\nNeoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic output, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right\u2014keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low.\nIf aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures.\nFigure 12.7 How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long Run\nAs aggregate demand shifts to the right, from AD0 to AD1 to AD2, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However, there is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E0 to E1 to E2.\nFigure 12.7 shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from AD0 to AD1 to AD2. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E0 to E1 to E2, the price level rises, but real GDP does not budge, nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely, reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about Figure 12.7 in reverse, as the aggregate demand curve shifts from AD2 to AD1 to AD0, and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E1 to E0. During this process, the price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural unemployment rate changes.\n  \n  \n    \nVisit this FRED blog post, How to Measure Inflation Expectations, to learn about how inflation and unemployment are related.\n  \nFighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?\nNeoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of potential GDP.\nWe know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953\u20131972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973\u20131992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993\u20132014, productivity growth increased slightly to 2% per year.\n  \n    \n      The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run\n      productivity growth to be an economy's investments in human capital,\n      physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented\n      environment that rewards innovation. Government policy should focus on\n      promoting these factors.\n    \n  \nSummary\nNeoclassical Economics versus Keynesian Economics\nLet's summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the economy. They believe that a stable economic environment with a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote improvements in technology.\nNeoclassical Economics versus Keynesian Economics\nTable 12.2 summarizes the key differences between the two schools of thought.\n  \n    Summary\n    Neoclassical Economics\n    Keynesian Economics\n  \n  \n    Focus: long-term or short term\n    Long-term\n    Short-term\n  \n  \n    Prices and wages: sticky or flexible?\n    Flexible\n    Sticky\n  \n  \n    \n      Economic output: Primarily determined by aggregate demand or aggregate\n      supply?\n    \n    Aggregate supply\n    Aggregate demand\n  \n  \n    Aggregate supply: vertical or upward-sloping?\n    Vertical\n    Upward-sloping\n  \n  \n    Phillips curve vertical or downward-sloping\n    Vertical\n    Downward sloping\n  \n  \n    Is aggregate demand a useful tool for controlling inflation?\n    Yes\n    Yes\n  \n  \n    \n      What should be the primary area of policy emphasis for reducing\n      unemployment?\n    \n    \n      Reform labor market institutions to reduce natural rate of unemployment\n    \n    Increase aggregate demand to eliminate cyclical unemployment\n  \n  \n    Is aggregate demand a useful tool for ending recession?\n    \n      At best, only in the short-run temporary sense, but may just increase\n      inflation instead\n    \n    Yes\n  \nTable 12.2 Neoclassical versus Keynesian Economics\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary policy", "aggregate demand", "neoclassical Phillips curve", "government policy", "inflation expectations", "nominal interest rate", "loans", "expected inflation factor", "positive demand", "neoclassical scholes", "aggregate supply curve", "shortrun upward", "work it out", "inflation", "unemployment rates", "table 121", "inflation rate", "inflation", "tapper", "economic intervention", "consumer relationship management", "unemployment", "structural unemployment", "business cycle", "job vacancies", "welfare programs", "jobhun", "longterm growth", "neoclassical economists", "economic growth", "growth rate", "human capital", "neoclassical economics", "Keynesian economics", "macroeconomic policy", "stable economic", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "12-03": {"text": "Learn with Videos\nBring It Home\nNavigating Unchartered Waters\nWere the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective? Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees.\nAlan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics found that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than 3.3% in 2008 followed by 0.1% in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler.\nFederal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect? that once the government implemented policies, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.\nThe difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the stabilization policies that the government took in response to the Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened had the government not implemented those policies. Surely some of the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while other programs were less so. The conclusion on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the U.S. dollar's value in the financial market.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "government", "financial markets", "tARP", "financial industry", "carlo eusip", "ch", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "13-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the various functions of money - Contrast commodity money and fiat money\nMoney for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account. Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842\u20131914) wrote in 1911, money is a \u201cblessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we part with it.\u201d Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus both buyers and sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.\nBarter and the Double Coincidence of Wants\n  \n    \n    To understand money\u2019s usefulness, we must consider what the world would be like\n    without money.\n  \n  \n    \n    How would people exchange goods and services?\n  \n \nEconomies without money typically engage in the barter system. Barter\u2014literally trading one good or service for another\u2014is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy.\nIn an economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different jobs and goods.\nAnother problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for purchasing many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.\nFunctions for Money\nMoney solves the problems that the barter system creates:\n1. Money serves as a medium of exchange, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money. The accountant then uses this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people must widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.\n2. Money serve as a store of value. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse for future use\u2014their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power each year, but it remains money.\nMoney serves as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure values. For example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.\nMoney serves as a standard of deferred payment. This means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that the purchaser will pay in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future.\n  \n    Thus, money serves all of these functions\u2014 it is a medium of exchange, store\n    of value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.\n  \nCommodity versus Fiat Money\nMoney has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells, cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these items as commodity money, they also have a value from use as something other than money.\nFor example, people have used gold throughout the ages as money although today we do not use it as money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry use it. Other industries use gold too, such as to manufacture energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry. As commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account.\nFigure 13.2 A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. Bill (Credit: \u201cThe.Comedian\u201d/Flickr Creative Commons)\nCommodity-backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have \u201cSilver Certificate\u201d printed over the portrait of George Washington, as Figure 13.2 shows. This meant that the holder could take the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar\u2019s worth of silver.\nUntil 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed money\u2014backed by silver, as indicated by the words \u201cSilver Certificate\u201d printed on the bill. Today, The Federal Reserve backs U.S. bills, but as fiat money.\nAs economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be a country's legal tender. The United States\u2019 paper money, for example, carries the statement: \u201cTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.\u201d In other words, by government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency has value, and nothing more.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary money", "fiat money", "dollars", "bank account", "humorist", "barter", "double coincidence", "advanced economy", "wants", "accounting services", "bar", "barter system", "accounting services", "shoemaker trading shoes", "warehouse", "deferred payment standard", "fractional equations", "gold", "silver", "cowrie shells", "cigarettes", "cocoa beans", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "13-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply - Classify monies as M1 money supply\n  or M2 money supply\n  \n    Cash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or\n    credit cards? Are they money, too?\n  \n \nRather than trying to argue for a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions based on liquidity. Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. You can use your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, $10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is less liquid.\nMeasuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2\nThe Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money supply.\nM1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler\u2019s checks.\nM2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds.\nM1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation\u2014the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable deposits, also known as demand deposits. These are the amounts held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the deposit holder his money \u201con demand\u201d when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items together\u2014currency, and checking accounts in banks\u2014comprise the definition of money known as M1, which the Federal Reserve System measures daily.\nA broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example, M2 includes savings deposits in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds, where they pool together the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) certificates of deposit (CDs) or time deposits, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1.\nFigure 13.3 The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money\nFigure 13.3 should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.\nThe definition of money M1 and M2 ranged from narrow to broad. The first one is more narrow\u2014M1 = to coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler\u2019s checks. The second one is more inclusive\u2014M2 = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.\nThe Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank's measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was $3 trillion, while M2 was $11.8 trillion. Table 13.1 provides a breakdown of the portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in February 2015, as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n Components of M1 in the U.S. (February 2015, Seasonally Adjusted)\n$ billions\n  Currency\n  $1,271.8\n  Traveler's checks\n  $2.9\n  Demand deposits and other checking accounts\n  $1,713.5\n  \n    Total M1\n  \n  \n    $2,988.2 (or $3 trillion)\n  \n  \n    \n      Components of M2 in the U.S. (February 2015, Seasonally Adiusted)\n    \n  \n  \n    $ billions\n  \n  M1 money supply\n  $2,988.2\n  Savings accounts\n  $7,712.1\n  Time deposits\n  $509.2\n  Individual money market mutual fund balances\n  $610.8\nTotal M2\n$11,820.3 or $11.8 trillion)\nTable 13.1 M1 and M2 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures (Source: Federal Reserve Statistical Release)\nThe lines separating M1 and M2 can get a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1 alike, accepting traveler\u2019s checks or cash while rejecting personal checks for large amounts. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, it is important to know that definitions of money are not as fixed as, say, the definition of nitrogen.\n  \n    \n    Where does \u201cplastic money\u201d like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit\n    into this picture?\n  \n \n- A debit card, like a check, is an instruction to the user\u2019s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable deposits that are money, not the paper check or the debit card.\n- Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, the financial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company.\n- With a smart card, you can store a certain amount of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases. Some \u201csmart cards\u201d used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use them for certain purchases or in certain places.\nOne key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts macroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation's banking system has the power to create money.\n  \n  \n    \nLearn about the monetary challenges in Sweden:\n  \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["m2 money supply", "cash", "credit cards", "economists", "financial asset", "hamburger", "m2 money supply", "cash", "checkable deposits", "travelers checks", "time deposits", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "13-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers - Evaluate\n  the relationship between banks, savings and loans, and credit unions - Analyze\n  the causes of bankruptcy and recessions\nSomebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. He answered: \u201cThat's where the money is.\u201d While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.\nBanks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if everybody had to make all payments in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.\nBanks are a critical intermediary in what we call the payment system, which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash. Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries\u2014they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key role in creating money.\nBanks as Financial Intermediaries\n  \n  \n    \n    An \u201cintermediary\u201d is one who stands between two other parties.\n    Banks are a financial intermediary\u2014that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank.\n    \n  \nFinancial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds, but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not depository institutions, or institutions that accept money deposits and use these to make loans. All the deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends to borrowers. Figure 13.4 illustrates the position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, they will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.\nFigure 13.4 Banks as Financial Intermediaries\nBanks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.\nClear It Up\nHow are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?\nBanks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money.\n  \n    Savings institutions are also sometimes called \u201csavings and loans\u201d or\n    \u201cthrifts.\u201d They also make loans and take deposits. However, from the 1930s\n    until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions\n    could pay to depositors. They were also required to make most of their loans\n    in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate\n    developers and builders.\n  \n  \n    A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and\n    run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member.\n    Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or\n    groups of employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union\n    accepts deposits from members and focuses on making loans back to its\n    members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than\n    savings and loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.\n  \nIn 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007\u20132009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were 6,535 credit unions with assets totaling $1.1 billion. The public rallied behind a \u201cTransfer Your Money\u201d day in 2009 out of general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as large as $50 billion. However, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve, as of 2013, the 12 largest banks (0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets.\nLearn with Videos\nA Bank's Balance Sheet\n  \n  \n    \n   A balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities.\n    \n  \nAn asset is something of value that you own and you can use to produce something. For example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If you own a home, this is also an asset. A liability is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank's balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank's net worth as bank capital.\nFigure 13.5 illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under \u201cAssets\u201d and \u201cLiabilities,\u201d we sometimes call it a T-account.\nFigure 13.5 A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank\nThe \u201cT\u201d in a T-account separates the assets of a firm on the left from its liabilities on the right. All firms use T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets include cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called \u201creserves\u201d), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds (i.e. financial instruments that either the bank is holding in its reserves or that other parties owe to the bank, like loans or U.S. treasury bonds).\nLiabilities are what the bank owes to others, including any deposits made to the bank by savers. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the liabilities side to have the T-account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank\u2019s T-account, assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.\nWhen bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in Figure 13.5, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.\n    \n        Loan is a category of bank assets. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank\u2019s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to the bank over time.\n        However, in practical terms, how can we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the borrower is paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value of something by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue home loans and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so. They then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where financial institutions make loans to borrowers the primary loan market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and sell these loans is the secondary loan market.\n        One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan in the secondary loan market is the perceived risk of the loan: that is, given the borrower's financial characteristics and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not repay loan, the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan.\n        Another key factor is to compare the interest rate the financial institution charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans in the secondary market is $5 million if sold to other financial institutions.\n    \n    \n        The second category of bank asset is bonds, which are a common mechanism for borrowing used by the federal and local government, private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds\u2014typically issued by the U.S. government. Government bonds are low risk because the government is almost certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.\n    \n    \n      The final entry under assets is reserves, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend or invest in bonds\u2014and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors\u2019 money on \u201creserve,\u201d which means either in their vaults or at the Federal Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will explain how the level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.\n      We define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure 13.5, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.\n    \nLearn with Videos\nHow Banks Go Bankrupt\nA bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities. The balance sheet can help us understand how this can happen.\nA well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank's loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure 14.5 experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.\nClear It Up\nWhat led to the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis?\nMany banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are \u201csecuritized,\u201d which means that they are bundled together into a financial security that a financial institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the security.\nSecuritization offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments. However, if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to local financial risks. In the example above, banks only own \u201cbonds,\u201d but in reality, they can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough to satisfy the government bank regulators. From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short time before selling it to pool into a financial security.\nSecuritization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more willing to make what we call \u201csubprime loans,\u201d which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments. In the mid-2000s, economists named these subprime loans NINJA loans: loans hat financial institutions made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets, or NINJA.\nFinancial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and turned them into financial securities, but with a twist. The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take, for example, the first 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25%, 30%, or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.\nThe economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. As housing prices fell after 2007 and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth much less than they had expected. The banks were faced with bankruptcy, and in fact between 2008 and 2011, 318 banks failed in the United States.\nThe risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank's liabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw funds quickly but many of the bank's assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades. This asset-liability time mismatch\u2014the ability for customers to withdraw bank's liabilities in the short term while customers repay its assets in the long term\u2014can cause severe problems for a bank.\nFor example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.\n  \n    \n    How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults\n    and against the risk of an asset-liability time mismatch?\n  \n \nOne strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans, which means lending to a variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market\u2014for example, making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.\nAlong with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan market, as we described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because customers will not repay a higher share of loans in tough economic times.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["bank robber", "checking", "debit card", "transaction costs", "bankers", "banks", "financial intermediaries", "financial market", "insurance companies", "pension funds", "money deposits", "bank failures", "credit union national association", "dallas federal reserve", "bankers", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "balance sheet", "accounting tool", "assets", "liabilities", "mortgage", "taccount", "bank", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "bank", "negative net worth", "riskiness", "loan defaults", "planning", "safe", "securitization", "banks", "mortgage loans", "financial security", "local economy", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "13-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks create money -\n  Analyze and create T-account balance sheets - Evaluate the risks and benefits of\n  money and banks\nBanks and money are intertwined. While most money is in the form of bank accounts, the banking system can also create money through the process of making loans.\nMoney Creation by a Single Bank\nStart with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all the deposits in its vaults, is in Figure 13.6. At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.\nFigure 13.6 Singleton Bank's Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits\nThe Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.\nThis change in business plan alters Singleton Bank's balance sheet, as Figure 13.7 shows. Singleton's assets have changed. It now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank's Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still has $10 million in deposits.\nFigure 13.7 Singleton Bank's Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans\nSingleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank's Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank's Auto Supply a cashier's check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as Figure 13.8 shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves but is free to loan out the rest\nFigure 13.8 First National Balance Sheet\nMaking loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank's Auto Supply writes checks to pay its bills the deposits will draw down. However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in reserves to meet its liabilities. The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded the money supply by $9 million.\nNow, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1 million) in a loan to Jack's Chevy Dealership as Figure 13.9 shows.\nFigure 13.9 First National Balance Sheet\nIf Jack's deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an additional $8.1 million, as Figure 13.10 shows.\nFigure 13.10 Second National Bank's Balance Sheet\nHow is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.\nLearn with Videos\nThe Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System\nIn a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the initial excess reserve amount that it decided to lend to Hank's Auto Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money supply will expand.\nIn a multi-bank system, institutions determine the amount of money that the system can create by using the money multiplier. This tells us by how many times a loan will be \u201cmultiplied\u201d as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.\nFortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The money multiplier formula is:\n$$ \\frac$$\nWe then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1 money supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier calculation.\nWork It Out\nUsing the Money Multiplier Formula\nUsing the money multiplier for the example above, calculate the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are complete:\nStep 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, whose reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.\nStep 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine\n$$\n\\begin\n&\\text \\\\ \n&&&=\\frac\\\\\n&&&=10 \\times \\$9 \\text\\\\\n&&&=\\$90 \\text\n\\end\n$$\nStep 3. Thus, we can say that the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.\nCautions about the Money Multiplier\nThe money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Bank requires banks to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves.\n  \n    Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons:\n    macroeconomic conditions and government rules.\n  \nWhen an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will discuss.\nThe process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the original reserves, is a result of bank loans that institutions repeatedly re-deposit and loan.\nFinally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank deposits are safe: If people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as \u201cmattress savings,\u201d or money that people are hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity of money and loans in such an economy will decline.\nLearn with Videos\nBring It Home\nThe Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bitcoins\nThe global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases, the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.\nThe latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat money is the Bitcoin and other blockchain currencies. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows users to buy goods and services online. Customers can purchase products and services such as videos and books using Bitcoins. This currency is not backed by any commodity nor has any government decreed as legal tender, yet customers use it as a medium of exchange and can store its value (online at least). It is also unregulated by any central bank, instead created online through people solving very complicated mathematics problems and receiving payment afterward. You can visit Bitcoin.org for more information.\nBitcoin is a relatively new type of money. At present, because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country, nor is it regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal as well as legal trading activities. As technology increases and the need to reduce transaction costs associated with using traditional forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency may replace our dollar bill, just as fiat currency replaced the cowrie shell.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["bank accounts", "money multiplier", "taccount balance sheets", "risks", "benefits", "singleton bank", "taccount balance sheet", "federal reserve", "interest payments", "cashier", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "money multiplier", "multibank system", "excess reserve amount", "first national bank", "work it out", "money multiplier", "singleton bank", "reserve requirement", "excess reserves", "g", "money multiplier", "federal reserve bank", "safedeposit boxes", "shoeboxes", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "baltimore", "global economy", "cowrie shells", "fiat currency", "credit cards", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "14-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve - Discuss\n  how central banks impact monetary policy, promote financial stability, and provide\n  banking services\nIn making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation. The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation's banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank's balance sheet.\nWe call the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation's financial system operates smoothly the central bank. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, we call the central bank the Federal Reserve\u2014often abbreviated as just \u201cthe Fed.\u201d\nThis section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve's organization and identifies the major central bank's responsibilities.\nLearn with Videos\nStructure/Organization of the Federal Reserve\nUnlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from political pressure so that governors can make policy decisions based only on their economic merits. Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional approval, and the President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.\nOne member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. While they have only one vote, the Chair controls the Fed\u2019s agenda and serves as its public voice. They have more power and influence than one might expect. From 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The previous Chair, Janet Yellen, has made many headlines already. Why? See the following Clear It Up feature to find out.\nClear It Up\nWho has the most immediate economic power in the world?\nFigure 14.1 Janet L. Yellen, the First Female Chair of the Federal Reserve Board (Credit: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)\nWhat individual can make financial markets crash or soar just by making a public statement? Not Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, or even the President of the United States, but the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\nIn early 2014, Janet L. Yellen, (Figure 14.1) became the first woman to hold this post. The media had described Yellen as \u201cperhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history.\u201d With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University, Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley.\nFrom 2004\u20132010, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Yellen became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble in the housing market, more than two years before the financial crisis occurred. She served on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent two years as Chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors.\n  \n  \n    \n    The Federal Reserve consists of more than just the Board of Governors. Visit this website to see who the current members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors are.\n    \n  \nFigure 14.2 The Twelve Federal Reserve Districts\nThe Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy in its district. Figure 14.2 shows the Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located. The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System includes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.\nWhat Does a Central Bank Do?\nThe Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:\n1. To conduct monetary policy\n2. To promote stability of the financial system\n3. To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, as well as to the federal government.\nThe first two functions are important enough that we will discuss them in their own modules. The third function we will discuss here.\nThe Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the \u201cdiscount window\u201d facility, which we will discuss in more detail later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check to buy groceries, for example, the grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery store's bank returns the physical check (or an image of that actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from your bank account to the grocery store's account. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.\nOn a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.\nFinally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to publicly disclose information about the loans they make for buying houses and how they distribute the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["upi", "central banks", "financial stability", "interest rates", "macroeconomic policy", "low unemployment", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "federal reserve", "central banks", "government appointees", "privatesector banks", "janus l yellen", "first female chair", "federal reserve system", "financial markets", "federal reserve", "banking services", "commercial banks", "federal government", "check processing", "grocery", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "14-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary policy - Explain\n  bank supervision - Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are\n  two strategies to protect against bank runs\nA safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only to protect individuals' savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of a failure of the payments/financial system.\nBank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into several categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make.\n- Banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves, as we learned in Money and Banking. \u201cOn hand\u201d is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors.\n- Bank capital is the difference between a bank\u2019s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank\u2019s net worth. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.\n- Banks are restricted in the types of investments they can make. Banks are permitted to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks. They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities, but to protect depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.\n  \n  \n    \nVisit this website to read the brief article, Stop Confusing Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation.\n  \nBank Supervision\nSeveral government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a level of risk.\n  \n    \n      Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n    \n    \n      Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the\n      Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of\n      bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so largest\n      national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have\n      branches in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the\n      Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan\n      institutions.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\n    \n    \n      The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) supervises credit\n      unions, which are nonprofit banks that their members run and own. There\n      are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy, although the typical\n      credit union is small compared to most banks.\n    \n  \nThe Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, we call conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses \u201cbank holding companies.\u201d While other regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding companies.\nWhen bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its behavior\u2014or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be sold to a financially healthy bank.\nBank supervision can run into both practical and political questions:\n- The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank\u2019s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in Money and Banking, a bank\u2019s assets are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.\n- The political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the bank's owners and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.\nFor example, many observers have pointed out that Japan\u2019s banks were in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.\nIn the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public, and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as many U.S. banks were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier, before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.\nBank Runs\nIn the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century, putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank\u2019s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money.\nFigure 14.3 A Run on the Bank (Credit: National Archives and Records Administration)\nWe call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits a bank run, as Figure 14.3 shows. In the movie \"It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\", the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits\u2014using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon.\nThe risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank's available cash. When the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession\u2014but they could make a recession much worse.\nDeposit Insurance and Lender of Last Resort\nTo protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place:\n1. Deposit Insurance\n2. Lender of Last Resort.\nDeposit Insurance\nDeposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC based on the bank\u2019s level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank\u2019s financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10\u201320 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have paid 50\u201360 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.\nBank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks' balance sheets, looking at the asset and liability values to determine the risk level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 5,898 banks (as of the end of February 2017). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many businesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.\nLender of Last Resort\nThe problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the lender of last resort role. For banks, the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money.\nThe lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises, as well. During the 1987 stock market crash panic, when U.S. stock values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can interpret the Fed's \u201cquantitative easing\u201d policies as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["bank regulation", "monetary policy", "deposit insurance", "lender of last resort", "national financial system", "bank supervision", "government agencies", "positive net worth", "foreign banks", "savings and loan administration", "bank runs", "net worth", "its a Wonderful life", "bank manager", "worried bank depos", "bank runs", "federal deposit insurance corporation", "riskiness", "bank deposits", "insurance premiums", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "14-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the reason for open market operations - Evaluate reserve requirements\n  and discount rates - Interpret and show bank activity through balance sheets\nThe Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation\u2019s monetary policy. Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto coin money\u201d and \u201cto regulate the value thereof.\u201d As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influence the level of economic activity, as we describe in more detail below.\nA central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:\n- Open market operations\n- Changing reserve requirements\n- Changing the discount rate\nIn discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a \u201cbank for banks\u201d\u2014that is, each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.\nOpen Market Operations\n  \n    \n    The most common monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations.\n  \n \nOpen market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a short-term interest rate, but one that accurately reflects credit conditions in financial markets.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes the decisions regarding open market operations. The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting members who the Board draws from the regional Federal Reserve Banks on a rotating basis. The New York district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills the other four spots on an annual rotating basis from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more frequently if necessary.\nThe FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chair has traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks, open market operations have been the most commonly used tool of monetary policy over the last few decades.\nTo understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in Figure 14.4. Figure 14.4 (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million.\nFigure 14.4\nWhen the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million, and the bank\u2019s reserves rise by $20 million, as Figure 14.4 (b) shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves, the quantity with which it started in Figure 14.4 (a). The bank, therefore, decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as Figure 14.4 (c) shows.\nThe central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking.\nWhere did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank so that Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air\u2014or with a few clicks on some computer keys.\nFigure 14.5\nOpen market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. Figure 14.5 (a) shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now holds an additional $30 million in bonds, as Figure 14.5 (b) shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in Figure 14.5 (a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring its reserves back to the desired level, as Figure 14.5 (c) shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking takes effect.\n  \n    \n    What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money supply? Read the following\n    Clear It Up feature for the answer.\n  \n \nClear It Up\nDoes selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?\nIs it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being outside the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank\u2014reducing the quantity of money in the economy.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for the Federal Reserve to learn more about current monetary policy.\n    \n  \nChanging Reserve Requirements\n  \n    \n    The second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise\n    or lower the reserve requirement.\n  \n \nThe reserve requirement, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank\u2019s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.\nIn early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million in deposits, then 3% up to $103.6 million,and 10% of any amount above $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes raised or lowered by a few million dollars.\nIn practice, the Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply, while loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks inability to meet withdrawal demands.\nChanging the Discount Rate\n  \n    \n    The third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or lower\n    the discount rate.\n  \n \nThe Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was founded to be the lender of last resort. In the event of a bank run, sound banks (banks that were not bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed\u2019s discount \u201cwindow\u201d to quell the bank run. We call the interest rate banks pay for such loans the discount rate. It is so named because the bank makes loans against its outstanding loans \u201cat a discount\u201d of their face value.\nOnce depositors became convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.\nIf the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.\nIn recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.\nThe phrase \u201cto afford means of rediscounting commercial paper\u201d is contained in the long title of the Federal Reserve Act. Adjusting the discount rate was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created, yet it has been barely used in the last few decades. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do so.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary policy", "open market operations", "discount rates", "federal reserve", "interest", "open market operations", "monetary policy", "us treasury bonds", "interest rate", "commercial", "bonds", "central bank", "bank reserves", "interest rates", "individual banks", "monetary policy", "monetary policy", "central bank", "reserve requirement", "cash", "vault", "central", "discrete rate", "federal reserve", "financial panic", "bank runs", "interest rate", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "14-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Contrast expansionary monetary policy and contractionary monetary policy - Explain\n  how monetary policy impacts interest rates and aggregate demand - Evaluate Federal\n  Reserve decisions over the last forty years - Explain the significance of quantitative\n  easing (QE)\nA monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy. Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy. This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the Fed's monetary policy practice in recent decades.\nThe Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates\nConsider the market for loanable bank funds in Figure 14.6.\nFigure 14.6 Monetary Policy and Interest Rates\nThe original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an 8% interest rate and a quantity of $10 billion in funds loaned and borrowed. An expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an equilibrium (E1) with a lower 6% interest rate and a quantity of $14 billion in loaned funds. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity of $8 billion in loaned funds.\nHow does a central bank \u201craise\u201d interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it is common to hear that the central bank \u201craised interest rates\u201d or \u201clowered interest rates.\u201d More precisely, though, the central bank changes bank reserves through open market operations in a way that affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, Figure 14.6 shows that interest rates change. If they do not meet the Fed\u2019s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.\nRecall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.\nOf course, financial markets display a wide range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate, which is for borrowing overnight, will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and borrowing set the specific interest rates.\nThe Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand\n  \n    \n    Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable\n    funds, which in turn affects several components of aggregate demand.\n  \n \nTight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce the aggregate demand. Business investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars.\nConversely, loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items. If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP.\nFigure 14.7 (a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD0) to shift right to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\nFigure 14.7 Expansionary or Contractionary Monetary Policy\n(a) The economy is originally in a recession with the equilibrium output and price shown at E0. Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift aggregate demand to the right from AD0 to AD1, leading to the new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output with a relatively small rise in the price level.\n(b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP level of output at the equilibrium E0 and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level. Contractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD0 to AD1, thus leading to a new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output.\nConversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In Figure 14.7 (b), the original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the original demand curve (AD0) to shift left to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\n  \n    \n      These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical;\n      that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic\n      downturns and upswings.\n    \n  \nThe Fed should loosen monetary policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation rises. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins. Figure 14.8 (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy to changes in output and the price level.\nFigure 14.8 The Pathways of Monetary Policy\n(a) In expansionary monetary policy the central bank causes the supply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in the short run, higher real GDP.\n(b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money and credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run, lower real GDP.\nFederal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades\nFor the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, we can summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.\nOf course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors influencing the macroeconomy. As we noted earlier, the person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the Federal Reserve chairperson.\nFigure 14.9 below shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate since 1975. Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.\nFigure 14.9 Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Inflation\nThrough the episodes here, the Federal Reserve typically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.\n  \n    \n      Episode 1\n    \n    \n      During the late 1970s, the rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10%\n      in 1979 and 1980. The Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise\n      interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to\n      16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand\n      contracted sharply enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980\n      and in 1981\u20131982. As a result, the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in\n      1979 to 9.7% in 1982.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 2\n    \n    \n      In the early 1980s, economists persuaded the Federal Reserve that\n      inflation was declining, so the Fed began slashing interest rates to\n      reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4% in\n      1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and\n      the unemployment rate had come down to 7%, and was still falling.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 3\n    \n    \n      However, in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again,\n      rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal\n      Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal funds\n      rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy\n      stopped inflation, which fell from above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992,\n      but it also helped to cause the 1990-1991 recession. As a result, the\n      unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 4\n    \n    \n      In the early 1990s, the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was\n      back under control, so it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds\n      interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy\n      expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5%\n      by 1997.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 5 & 6\n    \n    \n      From 1993 to 1995, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and\n      raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8%. Inflation did not rise, and\n      the period of economic growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and\n      2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it\n      raised the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5%\n      in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a\n      recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate\n      rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 7 & 8\n    \n    \n      Out of fear of Japan-style deflation in the early 2000s, the Federal\n      Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds\n      rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003.\n      Anxiety over such deflation led the Fed to lower their funds further than\n      they otherwise would have. The recession ended, but unemployment rates\n      were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the\n      unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the\n      federal funds rate until it reached 5% by 2007.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Episode 9\n    \n    \n      The Great Recession took hold in 2008, and the Federal Reserve was quick\n      to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0%\n      in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to near-zero by\n      December 2008, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market\n      operations could not make the interest rate turn negative. The Federal\n      Reserve had to think \u201coutside the box,\u201d which we will discuss in the next\n      section.\n    \n  \nLearn with Videos\nQuantitative Easing\nThe most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy\u2014open market operations\u2014works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing (QE). This is the purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand.\nQuantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.\nInstead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, another strategy that differed from traditional monetary policy. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed \u201ctoxic assets,\u201d because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing possibly \u201ctoxic assets\u201d from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen the financial system.\nQuantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:\n1. During QE1, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n2. In November 2010, the Fed began QE2, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n3. QE3, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending Quantitative Easing.\nWe usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central banks around the world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be temporary, then the Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE1 was somewhat successful, but that QE2 and QE3 have been less so.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary policy", "contractionary monetary policy", "interest rates", "aggregate demand", "monetary policy", "loanable bank funds", "8 interest rate", "6 interest", "monetary policy", "interest rates", "loanable funds", "business investment", "financial", "federal reserve actions", "federal funds interest rate", "open market operations", "macro", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "quantitative easing", "monetary policy", "open market operations", "interest rate", "private mortgagebacked", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "14-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more democratically\n  - Calculate the velocity of money - Evaluate the central bank's influence on inflation,\n  unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles - Calculate the effects of monetary\n  stimulus\nIn the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events:\n1. The central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy.\n2. The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates.\n3. When interest rates change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars.\n4. Finally, it will take time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.\nAs a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.\nExcess Reserves\nBanks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans.\nWhen many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they recognize that firms' sales and employees' jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP.\nJapan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan's economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the country's money supply by about 50%\u2014an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan's economy continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.\nClear It Up\nShould monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?\nShould a nation's Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives conduct monetary policy or should a politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take charge? Here are some of the arguments.\nThe Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy\nElected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is better to have elected officials who are accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees. After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve\u2014and to most central banks around the world\u2014are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.\nThe Case for an Independent Central Bank\nBecause the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy decisions happen much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.\nThe problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However, when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. Do not take this analogy too literally\u2014expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan's economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.\nUnpredictable Movements of Velocity\n  \n    \n    Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates\n    through the economy. We define the velocity of money in a year as:\n  \n \n$$\n\\text\n$$\nSpecific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was $1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 (which is $14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.\nSee the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.\nClear It Up\nWhat happens during episodes of deflation?\nDeflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession.\nRemember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and there is deflation of 2%, then the real interest rate is 9%. In this way, an unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers and can lead to a situation where borrowers do not repay an unexpectedly high number of loans. Banks will therefore find that their net worth is decreasing or negative and become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which can lead to recession.\nAfter causing a recession, deflation can make it additionally difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero\u2014but the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.\nIn the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930\u20131933, which caused many borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to go bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example, experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999\u20132002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period.\nThere is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from 1876\u20131900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip rate of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional severe recessions.\nThe central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.\nChanges in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:\n  Money\u00a0supply\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0velocity\u00a0=\u00a0Nominal\u00a0GDPMoney\u00a0supply\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0velocity\u00a0=\u00a0Nominal\u00a0GDP\nRecall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that\n  Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) \u00d7 Real GDP.Nominal GDP = Price\n  Level (or GDP Deflator) \u00d7 Real GDP.\nTherefore,\n  Money Supply \u00d7 velocity = Nominal GDP = Price Level \u00d7 Real GDP.Money Supply \u00d7\n  velocity = Nominal GDP = Price Level \u00d7 Real GDP.\nWe sometimes call this equation the basic quantity equation of money but it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form, as you can see above. This equation must hold true, by definition.\nIf velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP\u2014although this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP, or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.\nFigure 14.10 Velocity Calculated Using M1\nVelocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given year. We can calculate different measures of velocity by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\nFigure 14.10 illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured using M1, the most common definition of the money supply. From 1960 to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity, as calculated with M1, becomes more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how we are using money in making economic transactions such as:\n- the growth of electronic payments;\n- a rise in personal borrowing and credit card usage; and\n- accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2 until they write a check and transfer the money to M1.\nSo far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking, economists now favor M2 as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.\nIn the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman (1912\u20132006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable effects as desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real economy.\nIn addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: \u201cThe first and most important lesson that history teaches about what monetary policy can do\u2014and it is a lesson of the most profound importance\u2014is that monetary policy can prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.\u201d\nAs the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable ways. The instability of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.\nUnemployment and Inflation\nIf you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 14.11 shows. In the neoclassical model, economists determine the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) by real economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0, then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment.\nFrom this perspective, all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation\u2014and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.\nFigure 14.11 Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model\nIn a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the price level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate demand to shift from the original AD0 to AD1. However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1, but has no effect in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of output in this model.\nThis vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting, which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.\nEconomists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy\u2014even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons\u2014long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic goals\u2014monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.\nAsset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles\nOne long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the \u201cdot-com\u201d boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones Industrial Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The Nasdaq index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that followed.\nWe can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the \u201chousing bubble\u201d from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.\nAt a broader level, some economists worry about a leverage cycle, where \u201cleverage\u201d is a term financial economists use to mean \u201cborrowing.\u201d When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money multiplier determines the amount of money and credit in an economy \u2014a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of certain assets\u2014like stock prices or housing prices\u2014to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.\nThus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising \u201ctoo fast\u201d or in 2004 that housing prices were rising \u201ctoo fast,\u201d and then taken action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.\nLet's end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed\u2014or any central bank\u2014would stir up the economy by increasing the money supply.\nLearn with Videos\nWork It Out\nCalculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus\nSuppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?\n1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:\nMV = PQ\n4000 \u00d7 3 = 100 \u00d7 Q\n\nQ = 120 \n2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the increase in the price level. The new equation is:\nMV = PQ\n4,800 \u00d7 3 = 110 \u00d7 Q\n\nQ = 130.9 \n3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["monetary policy", "central bank", "time lag", "interest rates", "banking system", "excess reserves", "central bank", "money supply", "interest payments", "price level", "real", "monetary policy decisions", "congress", "legislature", "elected representatives", "central bank", "predictable movements", "velocity", "m1", "checking account balances", "nominal", "dynamic programming", "monetary policy", "real interest rate", "interest payments", "banks", "unemployment", "monetary policy", "central bankers", "neoclassical model", "economics", "asset bubbles", "central bank", "inflation", "unemployment", "us", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "monetary Stimulus", "central bank", "money supply", "bankers", "price level", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past five decades -\n  Explain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and state and local budgets\nGovernment spending covers a range of services that the federal, state, and local governments provide. When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a budget deficit. Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it has a balanced budget. For example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 10% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2009, making it by far the largest budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to finance World War II.\nThis section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.\nTotal U.S. Government Spending\nFederal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $3.9 trillion in 2014. Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.\nThe top line in Figure 15.1 shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since 1960. The other lines in Figure 15.1 show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security, health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). State governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the final main category of government spending in Figure 15.1.\nFigure 15.1 Federal Spending, 1960\u20132014\nSince 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22% of GDP, although it climbed above that level in 2009, but quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while the share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables B-2 and B-22, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2014/content-detail.html)\nEach year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)\u2014in essence borrowing from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.\nThe interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1\u20132% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.\nWe investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more detail later in this chapter, but first, we need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is not the debt. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit(or surplus) refers to what happens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time. It is the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000 plus interest.\nThese four categories\u2014national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments\u2014account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as Figure 15.2 shows. The remaining 27% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending: international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.\nFigure 15.2 Slices of Federal Spending, 2014\n(Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/ Historicals/)\nAs Figure 15.2 shows, about 71% of government spending goes to four major areas: national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing. The remaining 29% covers all other categories of federal government spending: international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.\nState and Local Government Spending\nAlthough federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government spending is also substantial\u2014at about $3.1 trillion in 2014. Figure 15.3 shows that state and local government spending has increased during the last four decades from around 10% to around 14% today. The single biggest item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways, libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of all of these.\nFigure 15.3 State and Local Spending, 1960\u20132013\nSpending by state and local government increased from about 10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14\u201316% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single biggest spending item is education, including both K\u201312 spending and support for public colleges and universities, which has been about 4\u20135% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis.)\nU.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local government responsibilities. In fiscal year 2014 state and local governments spent about $840 billion per year on education (including K\u201312 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal government, according to usgovernmentspending.com. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["government spending", "us budget deficit", "surplus trends", "federal budget", "state", "federal spending", "nominal dollars", "national defense", "social security", "health programs", "state and local government spending", "federal budget spending", "k\u201312 spending", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Differentiate among a regressive tax, a proportional tax, and a progressive tax\n  - Identify major revenue sources for the U.S. federal budget\nThere are two main categories of taxes: those that the federal government collects and those that the state and local governments collect. What percentage the government collects and for what it uses that revenue varies greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.\nFederal Taxes\nJust as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially.\nFigure 15.4 Federal Taxes, 1960\u20132014\nFederal tax revenues have been about 17\u201320% of GDP during most periods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2015. Table B-21,https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/ economic-report-of-the-President/2015)\nThe top line of Figure 15.4 shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except for 2009, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to the recession.\nFigure 15.4 also shows the taxation patterns for the main categories that the federal government taxes: individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most people think of federal government taxes, the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.\nThe second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax (captured in social insurance and retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80% of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.\nThe income tax is a progressive tax, which means that the tax rates increase as a household's income increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The marginal tax rates (the tax due on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.\nClear It Up\nHow does the marginal rate work?\nSuppose that a single taxpayer's income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.\nThe key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at $118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.\nIn both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his or her paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point out, the employer's half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.\nWe also call the Medicare payroll tax a proportional tax; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a regressive tax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.\nThe third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as Figure 15.4 shows is the corporate income tax. The common name for corporate income is \u201cprofits.\u201d Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.\nThe federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an excise tax\u2014that is, a tax on a particular good\u2014on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount the government collects from these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nThe government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation\u2014either after death or during life in the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010 but reinstated it in 2011.\nOther federal taxes, which are also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.\nState and Local Taxes\nAt the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as Figure 15.5 illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and charges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal government.\nFigure 15.5 State and Local Tax Revenue as a Share of GDP, 1960\u20132014\nState and local tax revenues have increased to match the rise in state and local spending.

Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits. During these years, the debt/GDP ratio drifted down.\nLarge deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply, but when budget surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/ GDP ratio declined substantially.\nThe budget deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher, with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008\u20132009.\nLearn with Videos\nClear It Up\nWhat is the national debt?\nOne year's federal budget deficit causes the federal government to sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference between spending programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding Treasury bonds on which the federal government owes money is equal to the national debt.\nWhat is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?\nIn 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly\u2014Social Security and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs.\nLong-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009 are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080. If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur:\n1. taxes will need to increase dramatically;\n2. other spending will need to be cut dramatically;\n3. the retirement age and/or age receiving Medicare benefits will need to increase, or\n4. the federal government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.\nSome proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.\nThe United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing proportion of the elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["us federal budget", "annual debt", "accumulated debt", "economic growth", "dynamic budget deficit", "accumulated debt", "annual deficits", "national debt", "federal", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "national debt", "federal government", "spending programs", "tax revenues", "elderly", "hospitalization insurance", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain how expansionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence\n  the economy - Explain how contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand\n  and influence the economy\nFiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time. Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources grow as the population and thus the labor force grows, as businesses invest in new capital, and as technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as Figure 15.8 illustrates.\nFigure 15.8 A Healthy, Growing Economy\nTThe original equilibrium occurs at E0, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.\nOne year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium(E1) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92.\nOne more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right, now to SRAS2, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD2. Now the equilibrium is E2, with an output level of 212 and a price level of 94.\nIn short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.\nAggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Consider an economy, in which real income increases over time. Increases in real income may increase consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply.\n  \n    \n    What happens to government spending and taxes during these shifts?\n  \n \nGovernment spends to pay for the ordinary business of government items such as national defense, social security, and healthcare. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result may be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much, or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.\nFor example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.\nLearn with Videos\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government spending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by:\n1.Increasing consumption by raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes 2. Increasing investment spending by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes 3. Increasing government purchases through increased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services.\nContractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.\nConsider first the situation in Figure 15.9, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2008-2009 recession.\nFigure 15.9 Expansionary Fiscal Policy\nThe intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E0), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD1, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level would rise to P1, the price level associated with the long-run equilibrium and potential GDP.\n  \n    \n    Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two,\n    to carry out the expansionary fiscal policy?\n  \n \nDuring the 2008-2009 Great Recession, the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s more than one year\u2019s average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The consensus view is that this was possibly the worst economic downturn in U.S. history since the 1930\u2019s Great Depression. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge.\nAs a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement expansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation, the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was partially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending.\nThe conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents. However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending, can use the AD/AS model. Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the government should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely economic one.\nLearn with Videos\nContractionary Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation.\nFigure 15.10 A Contractionary Fiscal Policy\nAs Figure 15.10 shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) occurs at equilibrium E0, which is an output level above potential GDP.\nEconomists sometimes call this an \u201coverheating economy\u201d where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD1, and causing the new equilibrium E1 to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.\nAgain, the AD/AS model does not dictate how the government should carry out this contractionary fiscal policy. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, the government needs to reduce aggregate demand.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["aggregate demand", "expansionary fiscal policy", "government spending", "tax policy", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "expansionary fiscal policy", "aggregate demand", "government spending", "tax rates", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "contractionary fiscal policy", "aggregate demand", "budget deficit", "aggregate supply", "overheating", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Describe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize\n  the economy - Identify examples of automatic stabilizers - Understand how a government\n  can use standardized employment budget to identify automatic stabilizers\nThe millions of unemployed in 2008\u20132009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries. Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy, when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2009 stimulus package is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.\nCounterbalancing Recession and Boom\nConsider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, both changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.\nThe process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy\u2014some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.\nA combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy produced the very large budget deficit in 2009. The Great Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe recession.\nA glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as we discussed in Unemployment). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991\u20132001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.\nThe Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus\nEach year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the standardized employment budget\u2014that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers.\nFigure 15.11 compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO\u2019s standardized deficit.\nFigure 15.11 Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit (Sources: Actual and Cyclically Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits, http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43977; and Economic Report of the President, Table B-1, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2013/content-detail.html)\nNotice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced.\nHowever, in the late 1990s the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like with the economy held constant\u2014at its potential GDP level of output.\nAutomatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.\nVisit this website to learn more from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website to learn more from the Congressional Budget Office.\n    \n  \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["automatic stabilizers", "federal fiscal policy", "spending levels", "unemployment insurance", "food stamps", "aggregate", "counterbalancing recession", "aggregate demand", "fiscal policy", "higher taxes", "lower spending", "standardized employment deficit", "budget deficit", "surplus", "normal profits", "automatic stabilizers", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-06": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected - Explain\n  the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems - Identify\n  the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem\nIn the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965, issue, Time magazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as \u201cthe prime influence on the world\u2019s economies.\u201d The article reported that policymakers have \u201cused Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent business] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.\u201d\nThis happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified several issues that make discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.\nLong and Variable Time Lags\nThe government can change monetary policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to enact fiscal policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two-month blip.\nEconomists often call the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred the recognition lag. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and then, if passed, eventually for the president's signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time. Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as the legislative lag. Finally, once the government passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs. Economists call the time it takes to start the projects the implementation lag.\n  \n    Recognition lag - the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred\n    Legislative lag - the time it takes to pass a bill\n    Implementation lag  - the time it takes to start the project\n  \nMoreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government should implement is never completely clear. Should it increase the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real world, we only know roughly, not precisely, the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew the true extent of the economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.\nThus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started\u2014and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be exactly wrong for the economy at that time.\n  \n  While the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes\n  instant results. The tension comes because, as I have seen on many occasions, the\n  economist\u2019s lag is the politician\u2019s nightmare.\n  George P. Schultz. Professor of Economics\n  former Secretary of the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and\n  Budget\nTemporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy\nA temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert to its original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.\nThis fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.\nStructural Economic Change Takes Time\nWhen an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the economy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as we discussed in Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead, the economy will need to grow in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic change\u2014the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement of workers to those industries\u2014inevitably takes time.\nClear It Up\nWhy do jobs vanish?\nPeople can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused job loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.\nThe Limitations of Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However, fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point, unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.\nLearn with Videos\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website to read about how fiscal policies are affecting the recovery.\n    \n  \nPolitical Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy\n  \n    \n    A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties\n    of explaining to politicians how countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against\n    the tide of the business cycle should work.\n  \n \nSome politicians have a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed, it is time for the government to stimulate the economy, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. However, countercyclical policy says that this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.\nPoliticians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were unsustainably low.\nHowever, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases. As of February 2017, President Trump has expressed plans to increase spending on national defense by 10% or $54 billion, increase infrastructure investment by $1 trillion, cut corporate and personal income taxes, all while maintaining the existing spending on Social Security and Medicare. The only way this math adds up is with a sizeable increase in the Federal budget deficit.\nDiscretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up\nExpansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.\n  \n    Expansionary fiscal policy is used to end recession\n    Contractionary fiscal policy is used to reduce inflation\n  \nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["fiscal policy", "monetary policy", "lag times", "economic problems", "business cycle", "cyclical", "fiscal policy", "economic statistics", "fiscal policy bills", "spending", "taxes", "permanent fiscal policy", "temporary tax cut", "spending increase", "aggregate demand", "structural economic change", "economy recovers", "internal structure", "construction sector", "finance", "housing", "job loss", "travel agents", "book store clerks", "shortrun fiscal policy", "unemployment", "fiscal policy", "aggregate demand", "unemployment", "output level", "inflation", "wages", "fiscal policies", "recovery", "political realties", "discretionary fiscal policy", "countercyclical policy", "tax revenues", "discretionary fiscal policy", "recessions", "contraction", "inflation", "interest rate", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "15-07": {"text": "Bring It Home\nNo Yellowstone Park?\nThe 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget.

Due to the severity of the 2008-2009 recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds.

Households might save more;\n2. Private firms might borrow less; and\n3. The additional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial investors.\nLet\u2019s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.\nThe National Saving and Investment Identity\nThe national saving and investment identity provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.\nThe U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings and public savings.\n$$\n\\text )\n$$\nThese include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit (we will cover this in detail in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter). For now, we can write this inflow of foreign investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let\u2019s call this equation 1.\n$$\n\\text \n$$\n$$\n\\text \n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm)\n$$\n  Equation 1\nGovernments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T \u2013 G) is negative. This causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G \u2013 T) instead of adding to the nation\u2019s savings. If this is the case, we can view governments as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. In algebraic terms, we can rewrite the national savings and investment identity like this:\n$$\n\\begin\n\\text  \\\\\n& \\mathrm)\n\\end\n$$\n  Equation 2\nLet\u2019s call this equation 2. Equation 2 helps us identify the sources of the financial capital. This is possible because we assume that the equality of quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds and a change in any part of the national saving and investment identity must be offset by changes in at least one other part of the equation. If the government budget deficit changes, then either private saving or investment or the trade balance\u2014or some combination of the three\u2014must change as well. Figure 16.2 shows the possible effects.\nFigure 16.2 Effects of Change in Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The Trade Balance\nChart (a) shows the potential results when the budget deficit rises or budget surplus falls. Chart (b) shows the potential results when the budget deficit falls or budget surplus rises\nWhat about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?\n  \n  \n    \n    The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal.\n    \n  \nHowever, the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit.\nFor example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses, although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the government was running budget surpluses, it was acting as a saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than demanding financial capital. As a result, we would write the national saving and investment identity during this time as:\n$$\n\\begin\n\\text  \\\\\n\\text  \\\\\n\\mathrm\n\\end\n$$\n  Equation 3\nLet's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is mathematically the same as equation 2 except the savings and investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.\nDuring the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a budget deficit, but the economy was typically running trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy is experiencing a net outflow of financial capital, we would write the national saving and investment identity as:\n$$\n\\begin\n&\\text \\\\\n&\\text \\\\\n&S &&= I+(X-M)+(G-T)\n\\end\n$$\nInstead of the balance of trade representing part of the supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial capital leaving the domestic economy and invested elsewhere in the world.\n$$\n\\begin\n\\text \\\\\n\\text \\\\\n\\mathrm)\n\\end\n$$\nWe assume that the point to these equations is that the national saving and investment identity always hold. When you write these relationships, it is important to think critically about what is on the supply and demand side of the financial capital market before you start your calculations.\nAs you can see in Figure 16.3, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has consistently run budget deficits since 1977, except for 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. Recall that T in the national savings and investment identity is net taxes. When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety-net expenditures like Social Security and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise. These deficits have implications for the future health of the U.S. economy.\nFigure 16.3 United States On-Budget, Surplus, and Deficit, 1977\u20132014 ($ millions)\n(Source: Table 1.1, \"Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits,\" https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals)\n  \n    \n    A rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in\n    private savings, or a rise in the trade deficit.

As the previous section discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means foreigners\u2019 holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that the U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often accompanies a budget deficit.\nTwin Deficits?\nIn the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. Figure 16.4 shows the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign investment capital matched, the considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget deficit and the trade deficit moved together.\nFigure 16.4 U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits\nOf course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and investment identity\u2014investment and private savings\u2014will often change as well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than twins.\nLearn with Videos\nBudget Deficits and Exchange Rates\nExchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits.\nFigure 16.5 Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates\nFigure 16.5 shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E0), where the demand for U.S. dollars (D0) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S0) on the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion per day. This was roughly the quantity of dollar\u2013euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s. Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for that budget deficit.\nInternational financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D0 to D1 and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S0 to S1. At the new equilibrium (E1), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.\nA stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.\nYou can also imagine how interest rates drive the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar appreciation leads to a larger trade deficit(or reduced surplus).\n  \n    \n    The connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates,\n    and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the same economic connections:\n    a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not\n    expect the connection to be one-to-one.\n  \n \nFrom Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis\nWe lay out the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession in the Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows chapter. When international financial investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate value depreciates, then Turkey\u2019s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.\nThe combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand, which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in 2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997\u20131998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.\nOne reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 175 years, the government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans six times. Brazil's government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.\nClear It Up\nWhat are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?\nIf a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent Brookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high compared to the country's GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:\n- As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.\n- Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.\n- Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in the country's ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.\nThe conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.\nWhat remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.\nUsing Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances\nIf a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.\nHowever, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country's exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.\nReducing a nation's budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["government budget balances", "foreign financial investment", "net outflow", "tax cuts", "spending increases", "twin deficits", "mid1980s", "foreign investment capital", "government borrowing", "national saving", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "budget deficit", "exchange rates", "foreign exchange market", "equilibrium quantity", "dollar\u2013", "budget deficits", "international economic crisis", "international financial capital", "lira", "international", "chronic large deficits", "usa", "budget deficits", "national savings rate", "financial capital", "fiscal policy", "foreign investment capital", "trade deficit", "foreign investors", "direct investment", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "16-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment - Explain\n  the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates - Identify why economic\n  growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology\nA change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people might reason that they will owe more taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing. As a result, they start saving now. If the government runs budget surpluses, people might reason that interest rates are falling the country will likely be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. As a result, they save less.\nThe theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772\u20131823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.\nIn practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses. Figure 16.6 shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses and the rate of private saving\u2014which includes saving by both households and firms\u2014since 1980. The connection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get very large in 2008 and 2009, there is some sign of a rise in saving.\nA variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study from the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar result.\nFigure 16.6 U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings\nPrivate saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short and the long run.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["government budget deficits", "interest rates", "human capital", "technology", "government budgets", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "16-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  \n  Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment\n  Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates\n  Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology\n  \nThe underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all set in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-functioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development that creates new technology.\nCrowding Out Physical Capital Investment\nA larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital. When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, economists call the result crowding out.\nTo understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S. economy's situation before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.\nFigure 16.7 shows the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980. If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down simultaneously.\nFigure 16.7 U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private Investment\nThis pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000\u2014a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP\u2014a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.\nThis argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, we must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% reaching $2,210.5 billion\u2014only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The \"crowding out\" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise, government borrowing may potentially create pressure on interest rates.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website to view the \u201cU.S. Debt Clock.\u201d\n    \n  \nThe Interest Rate Connection\n  Assume that substantial amounts of government borrowing will influence the\n  quantity of private investment.\n  How will this affect interest rates in financial markets?\nFigure 16.8 Budget Deficits and Interest Rates\nIn Figure 16.8, the original equilibrium (E0) where the demand curve (D0) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve (S0) occurs at an interest rate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at an interest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.\nA survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.\n  \n    \n    At this point, you may wonder about the Federal Reserve. After all, can the Federal\n    Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in\n    this case, to prevent interest rates from rising?\n  \n \nThis useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.\nAlternatively, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding out of the private investment.\nHowever, even a central bank cannot supersede the national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.\nPublic Investment in Physical Capital\n  \n    Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water\n    supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that\n    generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills;\n    telecommunications facilities; and military weapons.\n  \n \nIn 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports. Table 16.1 shows the federal government's total outlay for 2014 for major public physical capital investment in the United States. We have omitted physical capital related to the military or to residences where people live from this table, because the focus here is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.\nType of Public Physical Capital\nFederal Outlays 2014 ($ millions)\nTransportation\n\t$91,915\n  Community and regional development\n   $20,670\n  Natural resources and the environment\n   $36,171\n  Education, training, employment, and social services\n   $90,615\n  Other\n   $37,282\nTotal\n\t$276,653\nTable 16.1 Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014\nPublic physical capital investment of this sort can increase the economy's output and productivity. An economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even go out of business.\nIn some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in key politicians' districts. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense. It must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively can be difficult.\nIf a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment. Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a similar effect.\nIf a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.\nPublic Investment in Human Capital\n  \n    In most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment\n    in human capital through the education system. A highly educated and skilled\n    workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth.\n  \n \nFor the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much increases in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.\nAmong economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As Figure 16.9 shows, spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K\\\u201312) increased substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary education rose from $5,001 in 1998 to $10,608 in 2012. However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. On international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other countries. Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that there are no real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are just inaccurate. The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the resources spent.\nFigure 16.9 Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998\\\u20132014) in the United States\n(Source: Office of Management and Budget)\nOther government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K\\\u201312 education system. Programs for early childhood education, like the federal Head Start program, are directed at families where parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In countries in Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in nations in sub-Saharan Africa, only about one student in 20.\nNot all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government: many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic increases in education spending.\nHow Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology\nResearch and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy than direct civilian R&D spending.\nFiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on the R&D that it carries out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled $135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.\nLearn with Videos\nSummary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\nInvestment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth, as Table 16.2 summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment in physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might crowd out such investment. The impact of long-term investment strategies is obvious only after significant period of time, as work forces becomes better educated, there is more physical capital investments, and scientists and entrepreneurs invent and implement new technologies.\nPhysical Capital\nHuman Capital\nNew Technology\nPrivate Sector \n  New investment in property and equipment\n On-the-job training\n Research and development\nPublic Sector\n Public infrastructure\n Public education\nJob training\n Research and development encouraged through private sector incentives and direct spending.\nTable 16.2 Investment Role of Public and Private Sector in a Market Economy\nPlease write your summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["physical capital investment", "budget deficits", "interest rates", "economic growth", "human capital", "flexible prices", "crowding out", "physical capital", "budget deficit", "private saving", "trade balance", "government", "interest rate", "government borrowing", "private investment", "financial markets", "budget deficit", "demand curve", "public investment", "physical capital", "us federal government budget", "highways", "mass transit", "public investment", "human capital", "economic growth", "standardized tests", "SAT", "student academic", "fiscal policy", "research", "development", "national science foundation", "federal outlays", "physical plant", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "fiscal policy", "investment", "physical capital", "human capital", "longterm economic growth", "newspaper", "online archive", "postit software", "print shop pro"]}, "17-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Define \"foreign exchange market\"\n- Describe different types of investments like foreign direct investments (FDI), portfolio investments, and hedging\n- Explain how appreciating or depreciating currency affects exchange rates\n- Identify who benefits from a stronger currency and benefits from a weaker currency\nMost countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger neighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to dollarize\u2014that is, to use the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common currency is the decision by 17 European nations\u2014including some very large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy\u2014to replace their former currencies with the euro. \nWith these exceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring, borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency the foreign exchange market.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website for an exchange rate calculator.\n    \n  \nThe Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets\nThe quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking. A 2013 Bank of International Settlements survey found that $5.3 trillion *per day* was traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was $15.8 trillion *per year*.\nTable 17.1 shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The U.S. dollar dominates the foreign exchange market, followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.\nCurrency\n% Daily Share\nU.S. dollar\n87.6%\nEuro\n31.3%\nJapanese yen\n21.6%\nBritish pound\n12.8%\nAustralian dollar\n6.9%\nCanadian dollar\n5.1%\nSwiss franc\n4.8%\nChinese yuan\n2.6%\nTable 17.1 Currencies Traded Most on Foreign Exchange Markets as of April, 2016 (Source: http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfx16fx.pdf)\nDemanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets\nIn foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency\u2014and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: \n- (1) Firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services\n- (2) Tourists visiting other countries\n- (3) International investors buying ownership (or part- ownership) of a foreign firm (Foreign Direct Investment) \n- (4) International investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership (Portfolio Investment)\nLet's consider these categories in turn.\nFirms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm exporting abroad will earn some other currency\u2014say, U.S. dollars\u2014but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.\nInternational tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.\nWe often divide financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency into two categories. \nForeign direct investment (FDI) refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase, InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.\nPortfolio investment, the other kind of international financial investment, involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.\nBusiness people often link portfolio investment to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For simplicity, ignore any bond interest payment (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British pound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency.\nFigure 17.1 Figure 17.1 A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements \n \nThus, as Figure 17.1 (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600\u2014a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as Figure 17.1 (b) shows, that investor could start off with \u00a320,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately \u00a321,429 in British currency\u2014again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.\nMany portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. \nHowever, you do not know how much this contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let\u2019s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can hedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now\u2014regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time.\nNow, it is possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When parties wish to enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a financial institution or brokerage company to handle the hedging. These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange rate in order to earn money through the service they provide.\nBoth foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus. \nAs a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. Table 17.2 summarizes the main categories of currency demanders and suppliers.\nDemand for the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026\nSupply of the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026\nA U.S. exporting firm that earned foreign currency and is trying to pay U.S.-based expenses\nA foreign firm that has sold imported goods in the United States, earned U.S. dollars, and is trying to pay expenses incurred in its home country\nForeign tourists visiting the United States\nU.S. tourists leaving to visit other countries\nForeign investors who wish to make direct investments in the U.S. economy\nU.S. investors who want to make foreign direct investments in other countries\nForeign investors who wish to make portfolio investments in the U.S. economy\nU.S. investors who want to make portfolio investments in other countries\nTable 17.2 The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange Markets\n Learn with Videos\nParticipants in the Exchange Rate Market\nThe foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels.\nMost people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as dealers, then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the interbank market.\nIn the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all times.\nThe foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are about 23% of global GDP; which is about $18 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $1.5 trillion at the end of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $5.3 trillion per day traded in foreign exchange markets. \nMost transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment\u2014relatively short-term movements of financial capital between currencies. This is due in large part to large foreign exchange dealers' actions as they constantly buy and sell with each other. \nStrengthening and Weakening Currency\nWhen the prices of most goods and services change, the price \"rises or \"falls\". For exchange rates, the terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies, we refer to it as appreciating or \u201cstrengthening.\u201d When the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, we refer to it as depreciating or \u201cweakening.\u201d\nFigure 17.2 Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or Depreciate \nTo illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, in Figure 17.2 (a). The vertical axis shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency, measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in 1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60 Canadian by early in 2002. It then fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline in 2009 and 2010. In May of 2017, the U.S. dollar stood at $1.36 Canadian.\nThe units in which we measure exchange rates can be confusing, because we measure the rate of the U.S. dollar exchange using a different currency\u2014in the example in Figure 17.2, the Canadian dollar. However, exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by using a different currency.\nIn looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other. Figure 17.2 (b) shows the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian dollars in Figure 17.2 (a), is a perfect mirror image with the Canadian dollar exchange rate measured in U.S. dollars in Figure 17.2 (b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice versa.\n \nHigher prices of a typical good or service benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market participants.\nFigure 17.3 How Do Exchange Rate Movements Affect Each Group? \nConsider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as Figure 17.3 shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling \n(3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.\nFor a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the firm's profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country's exports.\nConversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency, will now buy more home currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country's level of imports.\nFor a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country's currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In 2010, $1 bought 7.3 South African rand, so the tourist had 36,500 rand to spend. In 2012, $1 bought 8.2 rand, so the tourist had 41,000 rand to spend. By 2015, $1 bought nearly 13 rand. Clearly, more recent years have been better for U.S. tourists to visit South Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country's currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.\nA stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.\nHowever, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.\nThe preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in Figure 17.3 illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions. \nLearn with Videos\nWork It Out\nEffects of a Weaker Dollar\nLet's work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.\nmissing Carousels\nStep 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 / $1.30 per British pound, or \u00a319,231. The dollar affects the price foreigners face who may purchase U.S. exports.\nStep 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = \u00a312,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.\nStep 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the opposite.\nStep 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States. If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is \u00a36.00 and the exchange rate is $1.30 per British pound, the price for the grocery store is 6.00 \u00d7 $1.30 = $7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 \u00d7 $2.00 = $12.\nStep 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S. imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.\nStep 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may choose not to travel at all.\nStep 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.\nStep 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the \u201cprice\u201d of investment, since the same number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of U.S. investment abroad.\nStep 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.\nAt this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved in international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next module shows how players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (we address \u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201d more in the following Clear It Up feature).\nClear It Up\nWhy is a stronger currency not necessarily better?\nOne common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cappreciating\u201d currency must be better than a \u201cweaker\u201d or \u201cdepreciating\u201d currency. After all, is it not obvious that \u201cstrong\u201d is better than \u201cweak\u201d? Do not let the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["foreign exchange market", "foreign direct investments", "portfolio investments", "hedging", "euro", "foreign exchange markets", "bank of international Settlements", "foreign exchange market", "u", "suppliers", "foreign exchange markets", "foreign firm", "part ownership", "financial investments", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "foreign exchange market", "financial institutions", "banks", "interbank market", "foreign exchange dealers", "weakening", "strengthening", "currency exchanges", "us dollar", "canadian dollar", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "weaker dollar", "foreign exporter", "united states", "dollar price", "foreign currency", "stronger currency", "exchange rates", "weaker", "depreciating", "currency", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "17-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain supply and demand for exchange rates\n- Define arbitrage\n- Explain purchasing power parity's importance when comparing countries.\nThe foreign exchange market involves firms, households, and investors who demand and supply currencies coming together through their banks and the key foreign exchange dealers. \nFigure 17.4 Demand and Supply for the U.S. Dollar and Mexican Peso Exchange Rate \n \nFigure 17.4 (a) offers an example for the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. The vertical axis shows the exchange rate for U.S. dollars, which in this case is measured in pesos. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of U.S. dollars traded in the foreign exchange market each day. The demand curve (D) for U.S. dollars intersects with the supply curve (S) of U.S. dollars at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 pesos per dollar and a total volume of $8.5 billion.\nFigure 17.4 (b) presents the same demand and supply information from the perspective of the Mexican peso. The vertical axis shows the exchange rate for Mexican pesos measured in U.S. dollars. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market. The demand curve (D) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve (S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note that the two exchange are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per peso).\nIn the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars. What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate? We discuss the answer to this question in the following section.\nExpectations about Future Exchange Rates\nOne reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the currency's value is about to increase. One reason to supply a currency\u2014that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market\u2014is the expectation that the currency's value is about to decline. \nFor example, imagine that a leading business newspaper, like the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso will appreciate in value. Figure 17.5 illustrates the likely effects of such an article. \nFigure 17.5 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates \n \nDemand for the Mexican peso shifts to the right, from D0 to D1, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S0 to S1, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange quantity rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1.\nFigure 17.5 also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market, like firms and investors, include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers\u2014that is, it affects both demand and supply for a currency.\nThe shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction. In this example, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is a higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.\nThis example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few weeks or months. When investors expect a country\u2019s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency's appreciation can lead other investors to believe that future appreciation is likely, and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a currency might weaken quickly leads to an actual weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief that the currency will weaken further. \nThus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-reinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.\nDifferences across Countries in Rates of Return\nThe motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country look relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of return will shift demand and supply for a currency.\nFigure 17.6 Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest Rates \n \nFor example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than previously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets and fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S. dollar will shift to the right, from D0 to D1, and supply will shift to the left, from S0 to S1, as Figure 17.6 shows. The new equilibrium (E1), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5 billion.\nThus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to appreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to depreciate or weaken. Since a nation\u2019s central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a central bank can also cause changes in exchange rates\u2014a connection that we will discuss in more detail later in this chapter.\nLearn with Videos\nRelative Inflation\nIf a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the currency. Figure 17.7 shows an example based on an actual situation concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986\u201387, Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, inflation dramatically decreased the peso's purchasing power in Mexico, and its exchange rate value declined as well. \nFigure 17.7 Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher Inflation \n \nFigure 17.7 shows that the demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D0 to D1, while the peso's supply increased from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E0) to $0.50 per peso at the new equilibrium (E1). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange markets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website to learn about the Big Mac index.\n    \n  \nPurchasing Power Parity\nOver the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the currency's buying power in terms of internationally traded goods. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded goods\u2014such as oil, steel, computers, and cars\u2014in one country than in another country, businesses would start buying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.\nFor example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.30 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United States should sell for $26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than $26,000, then at least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If the price of cars were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known as arbitrage, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It may occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.\nWe call the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison Program, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.\nThe purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. \nFirst, economists often use PPP exchange rates for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. However, should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange rates bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen was 121 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan\u2019s GDP was \u00a5500 trillion in both 2014 and 2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan\u2019s GDP will be $4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion /(\u00a5105/dollar)) and $4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion/ (\u00a5121/dollar)). The misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market exchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.\nThe second function of PPP is that exchange rates will often get closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the short and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the market exchange rates will often move away from the PPP exchange rate for a time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate relationships in the long run.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["supply", "demand", "exchange rates", "foreign exchange market", "firms", "households", "investors", "future exchange rates", "foreign exchange market", "mexo", "financial times", "rates of return", "foreign exchange markets", "us dollars", "interest", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "inflation rate", "foreign exchange markets", "big mac index", "equilibrium exchange rate", "pes", "purchasing power parity", "exchange rates", "internationally traded goods", "oil", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "17-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand and supply\n- Explain how shifting exchange rates also can influence loans and banks\nA central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: \n1. Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; \n2. frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation's banking system\nThis may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can set up the economy for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country. Let's discuss these scenarios in turn.\nExchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply\nForeign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.\nFor example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.06/euro. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S. dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. However, by the end of February, 2017, the exchange rate was once again $1.06/euro. \nConsider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs \u20ac10 million in costs, and sells its products in the United States for $10 million. In 1999, when this firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 \u20ac1/$1.06]), it received \u20ac9.4 million, and suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.37/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 \u20ac1 euro/$1.37]), it received approximately \u20ac7.3 million and an even larger loss. In the beginning of 2017, with the exchange rate back at $1.06/euro the firm would suffer a loss once again. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country. From the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages exports.\nSince an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports means more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are \u201cgood\u201d for the economy and imports are \u201cbad,\u201d but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for $20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has lost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and operate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and services, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves money by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nExchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets.\nFigure 17.8 International Borrowing \nFigure 17.2 earlier showed that even two economically developed neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in exchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, firms that rely on imported inputs to production, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade (sometimes half or more of a nation\u2019s GDP), sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to dramatic changes in profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too much in order to provide a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not on reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.\nOne of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system.  \nThe scenario of international borrowing that ends on the left is a success story, but the scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the exchange rate weakens.\nFinancial institutions measure most international loans in a few large currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies, banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own domestic currency. \nThe left-hand chain of events in Figure 17.8 shows how this pattern of international borrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the dollars to its domestic currency\u2014in the case of Thailand, at a rate of 40 baht/dollar. The bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank converts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.\nThis process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in the figure above illustrates what happens when the baht unexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the bank. However, because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars.\nIn 1997\u20131998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year through the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated, Argentina's banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.\nBanks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers. When most of a country's largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country's existing banks into bankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter on The International Trade and Capital Flows.\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["exchange rate shifting", "aggregate demand", "central bank", "international trade", "banking system", "exchange rates", "Aggregate demand", "foreign trade", "goods", "services", "costs of", "exchange rates", "india", "foreign exchange markets", "united states", "canada", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "17-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Differentiate among a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged currency\n- Identify the tradeoffs that come with a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged currency\nExchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed in Figure 17.9:\nFigure 17.9 A Spectrum of Exchange Rate Policies \n \n1. Floating exchange rate: Let the foreign exchange market determine the exchange rate;\n2. Soft peg: Let the market set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but have the central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too large;\n3. Hard peg: Have the central bank guarantee a specific exchange rate; or\n4. Merged currency: Share a currency with other countries. \nFloating Exchange Rates\nWe refer to a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates as a floating exchange rate. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world economy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.\nConsider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as Figure 17.10 shows. On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103 yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1, 2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. \nFigure 17.10 U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese Yen (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)\n \nAs investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large movements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse. However, even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent back and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the new exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.\nHowever, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services rise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong productivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.\nFloating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable, then inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce around less, too. The economist Milton Friedman (1912\u20132006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book *Capitalism and Freedom*:\n> \u201cBeing in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices are free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable.\u201d\n> \n> - Milton Friedman\nAdvocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out, however, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.\nUsing Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\nWhen a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the currency's exchange rate is different from what the market would have produced, it establishes a \u201cpeg\u201d for its currency. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.\nA soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but in some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will intervene in the market. \nWith a hard peg exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate. \nSuppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily quantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E0 in Figure 17.11 shows. \nFigure 17.11 Pegging an Exchange Rate \n \n(a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. \n(b) If an exchange rate is pegged above what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.\nHowever, Brazil's government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as Figure 17.11 (a) shows. Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. It could also be an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Brazil might alternatively believe that the current market exchange rate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it minimizes fluctuations in the real by keeping it at this lower rate. The government might have set the target exchange rate sometime in the past, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability.\nThe Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase the supply of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do not use this technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the country\u2019s monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil\u2019s central bank could trade directly in the foreign exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase foreign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency.\nFigure 17.11 (b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires a stronger currency to reduce aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or maybe they believe that the current market exchange rate is temporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.\nBrazil's central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates, which will increase demand and reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively, Brazil's central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S. dollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.\n  \n    Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market. However, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically allows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months or a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations. \n  \nLearn with Videos\nTradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\nWhen a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. \n- If it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. \n- If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. \n- Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even create additional movements of the exchange rate. \nOne concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country\u2019s monetary policy is no longer focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into account. \nFor example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession, but it cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. \nWith a soft peg exchange rate policy, the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession, but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate. With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.\nAnother issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves. Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit.\nIn addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.\nYet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy\u2014when anticipated in the foreign exchange market\u2014may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. \nThe following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows\u2014capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment.\nClear It Up\nHow do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?\nSome countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting international financial capital inflows and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through targeted taxes or by regulations.\nTaxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes, named after James Tobin, the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-term portfolio investment while exempting long-term foreign direct investment. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.\nThe goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope that doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.\nHowever, proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties. Governments impose taxes on a national level, not an international one. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried out within its territory, a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing might easily operate the exchange market. \nIn an interconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments need to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult\u2014in fact, close to impossible\u2014for a nation to allow only the flows of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a nation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.\nFinally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help develop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.\nA hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government first announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind\u2014perhaps the government becomes unwilling to keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves\u2014then the result of abandoning a hard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.\nIn the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-quarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach in favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern was that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time, lead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard peg exists. When the exchange rate does move, however, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have not planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, it was seen as better to either be clear that the exchange rate is always flexible or fixed. Choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up doing more harm than good.\nA Merged Currency\nA final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted the euro.\nHowever, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that a Portuguese central bank would have made.\nThese four different exchange rate policies can often blend together. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. Table 17.2 summarizes the range of exchange rates policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages.\nSituation\nFloating Exchange Rates\nSoft Peg\nHard Peg\nMerged Currency\nLarge short-run fluctuations in exchange rates?\nOften considerable in the short term\nMaybe less in the short run, but still large changes over time\nNone, unless a change in the fixed rate\nNone\nLarge long-term fluctuations in exchange rates?\nCan often happen\nCan often happen\nCannot happen unless hard peg changes, in which case substantial volatility can occur\nCannot happen\nPower of central bank to conduct countercyclical monetary policy?\nFlexible exchange rates make monetary policy stronger\nSome power, although conflicts may arise between exchange rate policy and countercyclical policy\nVery little; central bank must keep exchange rate fixed\nNone; nation does not have its own currency\nCosts of holding foreign exchange reserves?\nDo not need to hold reserves\nHold moderate reserves that rise and fall over time\nHold large reserves\nNo need to hold reserves\nRisk of ending up with an exchange rate that causes a large trade imbalance and very high inflows or outflows of financial capital?\nAdjusts often\nAdjusts over the medium term, if not the short term\nMay end up over time either far above or below the market level\nCannot adjust\nTable 17.2 Tradeoffs of Exchange Rate Policies\n \nGlobal macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set exchange rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow's news. If the government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.\nThere is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation\u2019s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation\u2019s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies.  \nA national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals. Finally, a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["floating exchange rate", "soft peg", "hard peg", "merged currency", "central bank", "floating exchange rates", "foreign exchange market", "japanese yen", "103 yendollar", "soft Pegs", "hard peg policies", "foreign exchange market", "central bank", "purchasing power parity", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "soft peg exchange rate", "central bank", "foreign exchange markets", "us dollars", "tobin taxes", "china", "malaysia", "international financial capital inflows", "out", "merged currency", "exchange rate policy", "foreign exchange risk", "euro", "germany", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "18-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers\n  - Identify components of the U.S. current account balance - Calculate the merchandise\n  trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a country\nA few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks transported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement the merchandise trade balance. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise less than half of a country's total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media prominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.\nComponents of the U.S. Current Account Balance\nTable 18.1 breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of 2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade deficit.

Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in services\u2014which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods\u2014the BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.\nThe BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data. For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital\u2014including banks and companies making financial investments like stocks\u2014must file reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks. The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in this chapter come from these sources.\nThe second row of Table 18.1 provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a surplus. Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2015, compared to one-fifth in 1980.\nThe third component of the current account balance, labeled \u201cincome payments,\u201d refers to money that U.S. financial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil shipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.\nThe final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers, which are payments that government, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any direct good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the country.\nFor the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an international coalition against Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.\nThe following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.\nWork It Out\nCalculating the Merchandise Balance and the Current Account Balance\nUse the information given below to fill in Table 18.2, and then calculate:\n- The merchandise balance\n- The current account balance\n  Known information:\nUnilateral transfers: $130\n- Exports in goods: $1,046\n- Exports in services: $509\n- Imports in goods: $1,562\n- Imports in services: $371\n- Income received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds: $561\n- Income received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472\n  \n    \n      \n      Exports (in $ billions)\n      Imports (in $ billions)\n      Balance\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Goods\n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Services\n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Income payments\n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Unilateral transfers\n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Current account balance\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \nTable 18.2 Calculating Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance\nStep 1. Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount of exports of both goods and services under the Export column.\nStep 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.\nStep 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money coming back to the United States. U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.\nStep 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money going out of the United States to foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S. assets, like stocks.\nStep 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United States in the form of, for example, military aid, foreign aid, and global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it under Imports and in the final column as well, as a negative.\nStep 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from exports in both goods and services. Enter this in the final Balance column. This can be positive or negative.\nStep 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country (under Imports) from the money coming back to the United States (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.\nStep 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the Balance column.\nStep 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between exports of goods and imports of goods\u2014the first number under Balance.\nStep 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance. The final balance number is the current account balance.\nThe merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is equal to $1,046 \u2013 $1,562, a trade deficit of \u2013$516 billion. The current account balance is \u2013$419 billion.

Figure 18.1 (b) shows the current account balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year.

If the lines are above zero dollars, the United States was running a positive merchandise balance and current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the United States is running a trade deficit and a deficit in its current account balance.\n(b) This shows the same items\u2014merchandise balance and current account balance\u2014in relationship to the size of the U.S. economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2015.\nBy either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses\u2014that is, the graphs show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. The trade deficit declined again in 2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and has remained stable up through 2016.\nTable 18.4 shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed include Brazil, the largest economy in South America and Latin America more broadly; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea in Asia.\nThe first column offers one measure of an economy's globalization: exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. The second column shows the trade balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP.

The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital. In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital using two models: a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.\nA Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nTo understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719, was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.\nIn this hypothetical economy, Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each person\u2019s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.\nHowever, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. \nIf Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.\nThis parable raises several useful questions in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The first question is: \nIs it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? \nThe answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson\u2019s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement. \nThe second question is:\nWhat can go wrong? \nRobinson\u2019s proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday\u2019s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps he has been too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay Friday as much as he previously agreed. \nAny of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday\u2019s attitude toward these renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.\nA third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. \nThe size of Friday\u2019s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson\u2019s trade deficit is exactly how much he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital, and a trade deficit means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.\nThe story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage, which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter. The following Work It Out feature walks you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s.\nWork It Out\nCalculating Comparative Advantage\nIn the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. Table 18.5 shows the varying hours of labor requirement.\n    \n        \n        Wheat (in bushels)\n        Cloth (in yards)\n        Relative labor cost of wheat (Pw/Pc)\n        Relative labor cost of cloth (Pc/Pw)\n    \n    \n        United States\n        8\n        9\n        8/9\n        9/8\n    \n    \n        Britain\n        4\n        3\n        4/3\n        3/4\n    \nTable 10.5\n \n \nStep 1. Observe from Table 18.5 that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.\nStep 2. Note the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/ 4 versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).\nStep 3. Note the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/ 4 versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).\nThe Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments\nThe connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments. Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.\nFigure 18.2 shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country\u2014the United States in this example\u2014and the rest of the world.\nFigure 18.2 Flow of Investment Goods and Capital\nThe top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the financial account.\nThe bottom four lines in Figure 18.2 show the flows of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. Investment income stemming from investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into the home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.\n \nA current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.\nIt is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may invest in another country\u2014by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["trade balances", "financial capital flows", "balanced trade", "investment", "capital flows", "twoperson economy", "russian Crusoe", "Friday", "trade deficits", "surpl", "comparative advantage", "united states", "british", "relative labor cost", "wheat", "balance of payments", "international flows", "financial capital", "us exports", "home country", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "18-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Explain the determinants of trade and current account balance - Identify and\n  calculate supply and demand for financial capital - Explain how a nation's own\n  level of domestic saving and investment determines a nation's balance of trade\n  - Predict the rising and falling of trade deficits based on a nation's saving and\n  investment identity\nWe can analyze the close connection between trade balances and international flows of savings and investments using a tool that views trade balances\u2014and their associated flows of financial capital\u2014in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy: the national saving and investment identity.\nUnderstanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance\nThe national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance. In a nation's financial capital market, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.\nClear It Up\nWhat comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?\nA country's national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is entering the country and the government considers it part of the supply of financial capital.\nThe demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.\nThere are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M \u2013 X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S. economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national savings and investment identity in algebraic terms:\n  \n    Supply\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital\u00a0=\u00a0Demand\u00a0for\u00a0financial\u00a0capital\n  \n  \n    S\u00a0+\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)\u00a0=\u00a0I\u00a0+\u00a0(G\u00a0\u2013\u00a0T)\n  \n \nAgain, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.\nHowever, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G \u2013 T > 0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side.\nHowever, if the government runs a budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T \u2013 G > 0), and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.\nSimilarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other countries.\n  \n    The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded\n    equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true.\n  \n \nDomestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital. However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.\nDomestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance\nOne insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation's own levels of domestic saving and investment determine a nation's balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and then the situation with a trade surplus.\nIn the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:\n  \n    Trade\u00a0deficit\u00a0=\u00a0Domestic\u00a0investment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0saving\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Government\u00a0(or\n    public) savings\n  \n  \n    (M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)\u00a0=\u00a0I\u00a0\u2013\u00a0S\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\n  \n \nIn this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.\nNow consider a trade surplus from the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:\n  \n    Trade\u00a0surplus\u00a0=\u00a0Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0saving\u00a0+\u00a0Public\u00a0saving\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Domestic\u00a0investment\n  \n  \n    (X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G) - I\n  \n \nIn this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be invested abroad.\nLearn with Videos\nExploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time\nThe national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause trade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on the left and the trade deficit on the right:\n  \n    Domestic\u00a0investment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0savings\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Public\u00a0domestic\u00a0savings\u00a0=\u00a0Trade\u00a0deficit\n  \n  \n    I\u00a0\u2013\u00a0S\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0=\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)\n  \n \nNow, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors constant.\nAs a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged. Table 18.6 shows the result in the first row under the equation. Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold\u2014it is, after all, an identity that must be true by definition\u2014the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit.\nThis situation occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial capital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n  \n    \n      Domestic Investment\n      \u2013\n      Private Domestic Savings\n      \u2013\n      Public Domestic Savings\n      =\n      Trade Deficit\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n      \n      \n        \u2013\n      \n      \n        S\n      \n      \n        \u2013\n      \n      \n        (T \u2013 G)\n      \n      \n        =\n      \n      \n        (M \u2013 X)\n      \n    \n    \n      Up\n      \n      No change\n      \n      No change\n      \n      Then M \u2013 X must rise\n    \n    \n      No change\n      \n      Up\n      \n      No change\n      \n      Then M \u2013 X must fall\n    \n    \n      No change\n      \n      No change\n      \n      Down\n      \n      Then M \u2013 X must rise\n    \n  \nTable 18.6 Causes of a Changing Trade Balance\nAs a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment and public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving\u2014although exactly how to increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.\nAs a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986\u2014an increase in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5 billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986\u2014an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of $152 billion. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S. economy's demand for financial capital, and foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.\nWork It Out\nSolving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity\nUse the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200 billion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic investment of $500 billion. To reduce the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does private domestic savings have to increase?\nStep 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the trade deficit or surplus on the left:\n$$\n(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\n$$\nStep 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a negative number (X \u2013 M). The left side of your formula is now:\n$$\n\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\n$$\nStep 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the formula:\n$$\n\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\n$$\nStep 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the formula:\n$$\n\u2013200 = 500 + (T \u2013 G) \u2013 500 \u2013200 = 500 + (T \u2013 G) \u2013 500\n$$\nStep 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by (T \u2013 G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T \u2013 G) of \u2013200:\n$$\n\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500\u00a0\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500\n$$\nStep 6. Your formula now is:\n$$\n(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u2013200\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500\n$$\nThe question is: To reduce your trade deficit $(X \u2013 M)$ of $\u2013200$ to $\u2013100$ (in billions of dollars), by how much will savings have to rise?\n$$\n(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u2013100\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500600\u00a0=\u00a0S(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I\u2013100\u00a0=\u00a0S\u00a0+\u00a0(\u2013200)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0500600\u00a0=\u00a0S\n$$\nStep 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by \\$100 billion, to a total of \\$600 billion, for the two sides of the equation to remain equal $(\u2013100 = \u2013100)$.\nShort-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance\nIn the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing can affect trade imbalances. A recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller.\nAs an example, note in Figure 18.2 that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not fall by as much.\nConversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often accompanies a rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit) accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic economy.\nWhen the trade deficit rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways. For example, reduced private savings could offset the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet another possibility is that greater government borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital, leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur\u2014only that one of them must occur.\nPlease your write summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["trade", "current account balance", "financial capital", "domestic saving", "investment", "trade", "determinants", "trade", "current account balance", "national saving", "investment identity", "national savings", "domestic savings", "public savings", "trade deficit", "business investment", "domestic saving", "investment", "national saving and investment identity", "trade deficit", "government saving", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "trade Balances", "national saving", "investment identity", "domestic savings", "public\u00a0domestic", "solving", "saving and investment identity", "private domestic savings", "government deficit", "private", "business cycle", "trade balance", "trade imbalances", "economic growth", "foreign", "newspaper", "feedback", "public services partnerships", "technical services"]}, "18-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a healthy economy\n- Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a weaker economy\nBecause flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the same as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much\u2014as anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify\u2014borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.\nIt makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education, because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in ways that will tend to raise the nation's economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.\nOne vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during the nineteenth century. The U.S. ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. \nClear It Up\nAre trade deficits always harmful?\nFor most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900.\nThe U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment\u2014railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools\u2014which were important to helping the U.S. economy grow.\nWe should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign financial capital represented no more than 6\u201310% of the funds that the government used for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.\nA more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s\u2014and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses\u2014that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending capital abroad.\nIn contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can find itself in a bind if it does not invest the incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased productivity. Several of Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.\nWhat happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia\u2014Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea\u2014ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into a deep recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in The Impacts of Government Borrowing.\nWhile a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan's trade surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.\nClear It Up\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.\nPerhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan's economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, many, especially non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause or a result of its robust economic health. However, from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan's economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.\nInstead, Japan's trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan's slow economy, consumption of imports is relatively low, and the growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan's exports continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan's trade surpluses began to deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a surplus.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["bank", "trade deficit", "financial payments", "international trade", "credit card", "economic", "trade deficits", "us economy", "foreign capital", "railwayroads", "trade surpluses", "japanese", "1990s", "economic growth", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "18-06": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Identify three factors that influence a country's level of trade\n- Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade\nA nation's *level* of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the *balance* of trade, but these two are actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade\u2014measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP\u2014while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also possible for a country's trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in Measuring Trade Balances, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.\nA country\u2019s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. We measure this by the percent of exports out of GDP. It indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries, such as Germany, have a high level of trade; they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. For example, the United States only exports 13% of GDP, but it has a trade deficit of over $500 billion.\nThree factors strongly influence a nation's level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade, while others do not.\nConsequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world average.\nThe balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus in 2015, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2015, while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.\nIn short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. \nThe following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.\nClear It Up\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.\nIndia was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century\u2014which was not true.\nInstead, India's trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial capital flow as the \u201cdrain,\u201d and they viewed eliminating the financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving independence.\nFinal Thoughts about Trade Balances\nTrade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of zero\u2014which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the international economy\u2014can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation's economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.\nIt is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the labels that people and the news media use to talk about them. If we called a trade deficit \u201cattracting foreign financial capital\u201d\u2014which accurately describes what a trade deficit means\u2014then trade deficits might look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus \u201cshipping financial capital abroad\u201d\u2014which accurately captures what a trade surplus does\u2014then trade surpluses might look less attractive. \nEither way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international payments,and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey ofunderstanding is to move beyond knee-jerk reactions to terms like \u201ctrade surplus,\u201d \u201ctrade balance,\u201d and \u201ctrade deficit.\u201d\nLearn with Videos\nBring It Home\nMore than Meets the Eye in the Congo\nNow that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.\nYou now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is performing well or not. The Democratic Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned at the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance is \u2013$2.8 billion. \nThe return of political stability and rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war in the Congo, however, has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt\u2014and that is a good thing.\nPlease your write summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["g", "balance of trade", "trade deficit", "germany", "europe", "trade surpluses", "india", "great germany", "financial capital flow", "independence", "trade deficits", "economy", "trade surpluses", "international economy", "borrowing", "lending", "foreign", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "dynamic programming", "investment", "financial capital", "negative current account balance", "political stability", "newspaper", "feedback", "public services partnerships", "technical services"]}, "19-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity costs - Explain\n  the gains of trade created when a country specializes\n  \n  No nation was ever ruined by trade\n  \n  Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)\nMany economists would express their attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner. The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has accompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many national economies that have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades\u2014for example, Japan, South Korea, China, and India\u2014have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute advantage.\nIn 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant, we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.\nA country has an absolute advantage over another country in producing a good if it uses fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country\u2019s natural endowment. For example, extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of drilling a hole. Producing oil in other countries can require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction, if they have any oil at all. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world\u2019s richest copper mines.\nAs some have argued, geography is destiny. Chile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade. When each country has a product others need and it can produce it with fewer resources, then it is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about trade just in terms of geography and absolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage\nLearn with Videos\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for a list of articles and podcasts pertaining to international trade topics.\n    \n  \nA Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nConsider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil and corn. Also assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources.\nTable 19.1 illustrates the advantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each good. Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in producing oil because it only takes an hour to produce a barrel of oil compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an absolute advantage in producing corn, as it only takes them an hour to produce a bushel of corn compared to four hours in Saudi Arabia.\nCountry\nOil (hours per barrel)\nCorn (hours per bushel)\nSaudi Arabia\n1\n4\nUnited States\n2\n1\nTable 19.1 How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn\nTo simplify, let\u2019s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours (see Table 19.2). Figure 19.1 illustrates what each country can produce on its own using a production possibility frontier (PPF) graph. Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case workers, and its level of technology.\nCountry\nOil Production using 100 worker hours (barrels)\n\nCorn Production using 100 worker hours (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia\n100\nor\n25\nUnited States\n50\nor\n100\nTable 19.2 Production Possibilities before Trade\nFigure 19.1 Production Possibilities Frontiers\n(a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil, leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in Table 19.1.\n(b) If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are possible, such as point C'. All points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current level of resources and technology.\nArguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let's say that before trade occurs, both countries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60 worker hours to produce oil, as Table 19.3 shows. Given the information in Table 19.1, this choice implies that it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to produce a bushel of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S. economy devotes 40 worker hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of corn.\nCountry\nOil Production (barrels)\nCorn Production (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia (C)\n60\n10\n  United States (C')\n  20\n  60\nTotal World Production\n80\n70\nTable 19.3 Production before Trade\nThe slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of corn. Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil or 100 bushels of corn; therefore, the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn\u2014or a slope of 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil or 25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.\nTable 19.4 summarizes these calculations. Recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity cost of producing goods. Since Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, (1/4 \nCountry\nOpportunity cost of one unit \u2014 Oil (in terms of corn)\nOpportunity cost of one unit \u2014 Corn (in terms of oil)\nSaudi Arabia\n\u00bc\n4\nUnited States\n2\n\u00bd\nTable 19.4 Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage\nIn this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see Table 19.1), and also gives up the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see Table 19.4). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will show. First, read the following Clear It Up feature to make sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.\nClear It Up\nCan a production possibility frontier be straight?\nWhen you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity we drew it with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred inputs from producing one good to another\u2014like from education to health services\u2014there were increasing opportunity costs.\nIn the examples in this chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a marginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional workers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage just as clearly.\nGains from Trade\nConsidering the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded their respective products:\nBefore trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States produces/ consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receive in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels, it will gain from trade.\nWith trade, the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade. Recall that Welcome to Economics\nSimilarly, if Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn greater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade. Table 19.5 illustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization, will benefit if it:\nThe Saudi Arabian economy, after specialization, will benefit if it: \nExports no more than 60 bushels of corn\nImports at least 10 bushels of corn\nImports at least 20 barrels of oil\nExports less than 60 barrels of oil\nTable 19.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Saudi Arabia\nThe underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the concept of opportunity cost, as the following Clear It Up feature explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it would be better off.\nClear It Up\nWhat are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?\nThe range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country's opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn\u2014or why trade at all?\nRecall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative advantage and specialization? Table 19.6 shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an increase in total world production.\nCompare the total world production in Table 20.3 to that in Table 19.6.\nCountry\nOil Production (barrels)\nCorn Production (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia (C)\n60\n10\n  United States (C')\n  20\n  60\nTotal World Production\n80\n70\nTable 19.3\nTable 19.3 Production before Trade\nCountry\nQuantity produced after 100% specialization \u2014 Oil (barrels)\nQuantity produced after 100% specialization \u2014 Corn (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia\n100\n0\n  United States\n  0\n  100\nTotal World Production\n100\n100\nTable 19.6 How Specialization Expands Output\nWhat if we did not have complete specialization, as in Table 19.6? Would there still be gains from trade? Consider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C', respectively, as Figure 19.2 shows. Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.\nFigure 19.2 Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia\nStarting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20, since 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi Arabia to reach point D, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn consumption has increased to 30. Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the trading price, in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, is greater than the country\u2019s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the post-trade consumption point D is beyond its production possibility frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.\nLearn with Videos\nLink It Up\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for trade-related data visualizations.\n    \n  \nPlease your write summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["comparative advantage", "opportunity costs", "national economies", "south korea", "india", "international trade topics", "podcasts", "content assets", "enterprise resources planning", "integration technology", "middleware", "comparative advantage", "saudi Arabia", "united states", "corn", "labor hours", "production possibility frontier", "choice in a world of scarcity", "opportunity costs", "education", "health", "trading positions", "united states", "saudi Arabia", "opportunity cost", "clear", "comparative advantage", "total world production", "corn", "50 barrels", "arizona", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "traderelated data visualizations", "data visualization", "link it up", "microsoft", "newspaper", "feedback", "public services partnerships", "technical services"]}, "19-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage - Identify\n  situations of mutually beneficial trade - Identify trade benefits by considering\n  opportunity costs\n  \n    What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute\n    advantage in everything?\n  \n \nThis is typical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board, will there still be gains from trade?\nGood students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one's comparative advantage.\nProduction Possibilities and Comparative Advantage\nConsider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 19.7. In this example, it takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of refrigerators.\nCountry\nNumber of Workers needed to produce 1,000 units \u2014 Shoes\nNumber of Workers needed to produce 1,000 units \u2014 Refrigerators\nUnited States\n4 workers\n1 worker\nMexico\n5 workers\n4 workers\nTable 19.7 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators\nAbsolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question, \u201cHow many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?\u201d Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, \u201cHow much am I giving up to produce this good in this country?\u201d\nAnother way of looking at this is that comparative advantage identifies the good for which the producer's absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer's absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico's comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.\nMutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage\nWhen nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both countries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.\nConsider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. As Table 19.8 shows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be produced.\nCountry\nShoe Production \u2014 using 40 workers\nRefrigerator Production \u2014 using 40 workers\nUnited States\n10,000 shoes\nor\n40,000 refrigerators\nMexico\n8,000 shoes\nor\n10,000 refrigerators\nTable 19.8 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization\nAs always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one refrigerator in terms of foregone shoe production\u2013when labor is transferred from producing the latter to producing the former (see Table 19.3).\nTable 19.3 Production Possibility Frontiers\n(a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000 shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes.\n(b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current resources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where they end up after trade.\nLet's say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators that is shown at point A. Table 19.9 shows the output of each good for each country and the total output for the two countries.\nCountry\nCurrent Shoe Production\nCurrent Refrigerator Production\nUnited States\n5,000\n20,000\n  Mexico\n  4,000\n  5,000\nTotal\n9,000\n25,000\nTable 19.9 Total Production at Point A before Trade\nContinuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 \u00d7 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 \u00d7 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 \u00d7 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 \u00d7 1,000).\nNotice that when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as shown in Table 19.10. The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.\nCountry\nShoe Production\nRefrigerator Production\nUnited States\n3,500\n26,000\n  Mexico\n  6,000\n  2,500\nTotal\n9,500\n28,500\nTable 19.10 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage Raises Total Output\nThis numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country has an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both countries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.\nHow Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade\nThis example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades that would benefit each country.\nBefore specialization and trade, Mexico started out producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see Figure 19.3 and Table 19.9). Then, it shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (a loss of 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off.\nConversely, before specialization and trade, the United States started out producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. It then shifted production toward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.\nThe range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 19.11. For example, a trade where the U.S. exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, because both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization, will benefit if it:\nThe Mexican economy, after specialization, will benefit if it:\nExports fewer than 6,000 refrigerators\nImports at least 2,500 refrigerators\nImports at least 1,500 pairs of shoes\nExports no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes\nTable 19.11 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico\nTrade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.\n  \n    The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have\n    different comparative advantages. It shows that the gains from international\n    trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and producing at a lower\n    opportunity cost.\n  \n \nThe following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country's production.\nWork It Out\nCalculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nIn Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber (see Table 19.12).\n  \n    Country\n    Oil (barrels)\n    \n    Lumber (tons)\n  \n  \n    Canada\n    20\n    or\n    40\n  \n  \n    Venezuela\n    60\n    or\n    30\n  \nTable 19.12\n1. Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?\n2. Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?\n3. Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?\n4. In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?\n5. In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?\nStep 1. Make a table like Table 20.12.\nStep 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.\nStep 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2 lumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.\nStep 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.\nStep 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.\nStep 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be exporting oil and importing lumber.\nLearn with Videos\nComparative Advantage Goes Camping\nTo build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve national economies for a moment, and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go camping together.\nSix friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person, Jethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all aspects of camping: He is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a meal, and washing up. Because Jethro has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the work?\nOf course not\nThe theory of comparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative advantage\u2014that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can all gain.\nPlease your write summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["comparative advantage", "highincome countries", "educated workers", "technologically advanced equipment", "production Possibilities", "comparative advantage", "united states", "mexico", "refrigerators", "comparative advantage", "usa", "mexico", "refrigerators", "zero refriger", "opportunity cost", "comparative advantages", "trading", "specialization", "refrigerators", "domestic opportunity costs", "comparative advantage", "canada", "30 tons", "oil", "20 tons", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "comparative advantage", "national economies", "jethro", "backpack", "gathering firewood", "newspaper", "feedback", "public services partnerships", "technical services"]}, "19-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n  - Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading - Explain the relationship\n  between economies of scale and intra-industry trade\nAbsolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns.

Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns of international trade.\nThe Prevalence of Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\nThe theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large differences in opportunity costs of production.

A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry trade\u2014that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another.\nFor example, the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos. Table 19.14 shows some of the largest categories of U.S. exports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States exported $146 billion worth of automobiles, and imported $327 billion worth of automobiles. About 60% of U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade.\nSome U.S. Exports\nQuantity of Exports ($ billions)\nQuantity of Imports ($ billions)\nAutos\n$146\n$327\n  Food and beverages\n  $144\n  $126\n  Capital goods\n  $550\n  $551\n  Consumer goods\n  $199\n  $558\n  Industrial supplies\n  $507\n  $665\n  Other transportation\n  $45\n  $55\nTable 19.14 Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2014 (Source: http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/tradnewsrelease.htm)\n  \n    Why do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade?\n  \n \n  \n    What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills\n    making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped\n    across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and\n    Japan?\n  \n \nThere are two reasons: (1) the division of labor, and (2) economies of scale.\nGains from Specialization and Learning\nConsider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but importing machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S., German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.\nSpecialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, there has been a trend in recent years in international trade, which economists call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages. For example, producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China, and advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication technology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead of production in a single large factory, different firms operating in various places and even different countries can divide the value chain.\nBecause firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve nations trading whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and innovate on particular products\u2014and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.\n  \n  \n    \n    Visit this website for some interesting information about the assembly of the iPhone\n    \n  \nEconomies of Scale, Competition, Variety\nA second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale means that as the scale of output goes up, the average costs of production decline\u2014at least up to a point.\nFigure 19.4 Economies of Scale\nFigure 19.4 illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50 units and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.\nIn this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a very large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional scale of production does not continue to reduce the average costs of production.\n  \n    The concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to\n    international trade when it enables one or two large producers to supply the\n    entire country.\n  \n \nFor example, a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no international trade, then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.\nInternational trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies of scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries can make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players in the U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than when U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to what consumers want. America's car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.\nDynamic Comparative Advantage\nThe sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies\u2014namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale\u2014do not contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.\nIn intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the general level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker productivity. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic\u2014that is, it can evolve and change over time as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.\nPlease your write summary below\n", "keyphrases": ["intraindustry trade", "comparative advantages", "global trading patterns", "ch", "intraindustry trade", "similar economies", "opportunity costs of production", "europe", "intraindustry trade", "united states", "japanese", "g", "economies of scale", "intraindustry trade", "economic gains", "average costs of production", "comparative advantage", "intraindustry trade", "similar economies", "learning", "newspaper", "feedback", "public services partnerships", "technical services"]}, "19-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain tariffs as barriers to trade\n- Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade\nTariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. \nSome of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world\u2019s nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in \u201crounds,\u201d where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement.\nThe current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank summarized recent research and found that the Doha round of negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by $160 billion to $385 billion per year, depending on the precise deal that ended up being negotiated.\nIn the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth remembering two points.\n1. A gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention2. The estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not measured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition among producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries, especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge that can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.\nLow-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and prices that consumers want.\nThe economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website for a list of some benefits of trade.\n    \n  \nFrom Interpersonal to International Trade\nMost people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.\nThe benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output for three reasons: \n1. workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative advantage; \n2. firms and workers who specialize in a certain product become more productive with learning and practice; and \n3. economies of scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.\nInternational trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["tolerant", "foreign investment", "domestic investment", "investment strategies", "foreign trade", "international trade", "division of labor", "comparative advantage", "international trade benefits", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "20-01": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain protectionism and its three main forms\n- Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium\n- Calculate the effects of trade barriers\nWhen a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade, it is engaging in protectionism.  \nProtectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition. Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.\nRecall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on imported goods and services. This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in recent years, large flat-screen televisions imported to the U.S. from China have faced a 5% tariff rate\nAnother way to control trade is through import quotas, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that a country can import. \nFor instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United States, found themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to \u201cmanage\u201d this loss of jobs and income, the developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided the market for textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers. The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed country would accept from each low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United States, which are still governed by quotas.\nNontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products.  \nA rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. \nThere are also nontariff barriers in the form of \u201crules-of-origin\u201d regulations; these rules describe the \u201cMade in Country X\u201d label as the one in which the last substantial change in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions may try to change the production process so that the last big change in the product happens in his or her own country. For example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped to other countries, combined with textiles made in those other countries to make apparel\u2014and then re-exported back to the United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a \u201cMade in the USA\u201d label.\nDespite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is imported rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell from 666,360 in 2007 to 385,240 in 2012, a 42% decline. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs. However, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing each year.\nWhen the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that product elsewhere in the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will likely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the economy and hence increase the number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the poorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a horrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.\nRealizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We\u2019ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter, but for now, it is important to note that this agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. The WTO is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules\u2014including rules about tariffs, quotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops a simple model to show the impact of trade policy.\nLearn with Videos\nDemand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism\nTo the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign producers and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as well.\nConsider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar, as Table 20.1 details and Figure 20.1 illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the equilibrium price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade in the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. We label these equilibrium points as point E in each part of the figure.\nPrice\nBrazil: Quantity Supplied (tons)\nBrazil: Quantity Demanded (tons)\nU.S.: Quantity Supplied (tons)\nU.S.: Quantity Demanded (tons) \n8 cents\n20\n35\n60\n100\n12 cents\n30\n30\n66\n93\n14 cents\n35\n28\n69\n90\n16 cents\n40\n25\n72\n87\n20 cents\n45\n21\n76\n83\n24 cents\n50\n18\n80\n80\n28 cents\n55\n15\n82\n78\nTable 20.1 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States\n \nFigure 20.1 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States \n \nBefore trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in Brazil is 12 cents a pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed, businesses will buy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in the United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15 tons of sugar and the United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between the countries, it will lead to an outcome between the free-trade and no-trade possibilities.\nIf international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will spot an opportunity: buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States. As sugar is shipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian consumption (with the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less than the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will reduce the sugar supply in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar supply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade further. As Figure 20.1 shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price, the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.\nThe extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is supplied by imported sugar. \nFree trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall gains from trade, as Figure 20.2 shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in Demand and Supply and Demand, Supply, and Efficiency, Figure 20.2 (a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while Figure 20.2 (b) shows consumers in the United States benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Comparing their no-trade consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus, Brazilian consumers and U.S. producers of sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade\u2014an increase in social surplus in each country. That is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade.\nFigure 20.2 Free Trade of Sugar  Free Trade of Sugar \n \n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website to read more about the global sugar trade. \n    \n  \nClear It Up\nWhy are there low-income countries?\nWhy are poor countries in the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: The trade policies of high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities widely publicized by the international aid organization, Oxfam International.\nHigh-income countries of the world\u2014primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union, and Japan\u2014subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $360 billion per year. By contrast, the total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to poor countries in the world is about $70 billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why does this matter?\nThe support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in high-income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production. \nAs Michael Gerson of the Washington Post describes it: \u201cT]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic\u2026keeping] millions of Africans on the edge of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a dollar a day.  Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000.\u201d\nAs if subsidies were not enough, high-income countries often block agricultural exports from low-income countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local farmers out of business altogether.\nFor example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers\u2014in many instances, the world\u2019s poor.\nU.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they could  be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the United States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in each country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.\nBlocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20 cents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14 cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic demand.\nIn general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.\nWork It Out\nEffects of Trade Barriers\nFigure 20.3 U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand \nLet\u2019s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller quantity of sugar, and U.S. producers obtain a higher price and sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in Demand, Supply, and Efficiency: consumer surplus and producer surplus.\nStep 1. Look at Figure 21.4, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United States.\nStep 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity Demanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of PTrade.\nStep 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.\nStep 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get beyond what they paid for when they buy a product. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer surplus in the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points PTrade, A, and B.\nStep 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit\u2014it is the income producers get above the cost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade is the area of the triangle formed by the points Ptrade, C, and D.\nStep 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to PNoTrade. Look what happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and D.\nStep 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.\nStep 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and B.\nStep 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area Ptrade, C, E, PNoTrade. The loss of consumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area Ptrade, A, E, PNoTrade. In other words, consumers lose more than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.\nWho Benefits and Who Pays?\nUsing the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in each of the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly positive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For consumers in the country with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. \nThe following Clear It Up feature considers why a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic product.\nClear It Up\nWhy are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?\nIn 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio. Starting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a year, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it would close the Michigan plant and move Life Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.\nOne reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not linked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the sugar price high for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on imported sugar. According to the Coalition for Sugar Reform, from 2009 to 2012, the price of refined sugar in the United States ranged from 64% to 92% higher than the world price. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.\nA number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production. From 1997 to 2011, sugar-using industries eliminated some 127,000 jobs, or more than seven times the total employment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar subsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output profitably, or at all, in the United States market.\nThe fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not always acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic producers, there would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a method of requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers pay for it through higher prices, rather than a direct government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers. However, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined \u201ctariff\u201d this way in his 1911 book, *The Devil's Dictionary*: \u201cTariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.\u201d\nThe effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When a government uses an import quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower price for the sugar they sell in Brazil\u2014but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United States. \nNotice that some of the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of foreign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On the other hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes and jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers would miss out on better prices for imported goods\u2014which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.\nThe effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product (households or other firms) to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discussed in International Trade.\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["protectionism", "demand", "supply", "international trade", "domestic producers", "domestic workers", "nontar", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "supply analysis", "protectionism", "brazil", "united states", "domestic supply", "lowincome countries", "trade policies", "international aid organization", "domestic farmers", "foreign aid", "consumer surplus", "us government", "tariff", "quota", "brazil", "demand", "supply model", "protectionism", "us sugar farmers", "imported products", "life savers", "hard candy", "hamburg", "korea", "canada", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "20-02": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Discuss how international trade influences the job market\n- Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism\n- Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and working conditions\nThere\u2019s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: \u201cBuy American\u2014Save U.S. Jobs.\u201d If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: \u201cBlock Imports\u2014Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.\u201d\nContrary to popular opinion, imports might actually injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working condition. Let\u2019s consider these in turn.\nFewer Jobs?\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.\nThis result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for decades, not just since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs, then the United States should have been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates\u2014according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2007 to late 2009, the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% to 10%. It has since fallen back to under 5% as of the end of 2016\u2014the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time. The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 145 million in 2014.\nProtectionism certainly saves jobs in the protected industry, but it costs jobs in other unprotected industries for two main reasons:\n- If consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries.\n- If a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs.\n  \nThe hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade Commission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are protected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.\nMoreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism. Table 20.2 shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker\u2019s salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel, as Table 20.2 shows.\nIndustry Protected with Import Tariffs or Quotas\nAnnual Cost per Job Saved\nSugar\n$826,000\nPolyethylene resins\n$812,000\nDairy products\n$685,000\nFrozen concentrated orange juice\n$635,000\nBall bearings\n$603,000\nMachine tools\n$479,000\nWomen\u2019s handbags\n$263,000\nGlassware\n$247,000\nApparel and textiles\n$199,000\nRubber footwear\n$168,000\nWomen\u2019s nonathletic footwear\n$139,000\nTable 20.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\nThe reason it costs so much to save jobs through protectionism is that not all of the extra money that consumers pay from tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees\u2014and also avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs.\nAlso, when an industry is protected, the overall economy loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage\u2014in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what we discussed in Labor and Financial Markets.\nTrade and Wages\nEven if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. \nwages.\nHere, it is important to separate issues about the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade. \nBecause trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their comparative advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who can produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an economy.\nHowever, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for their labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade. Conversely, workers in industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their wages.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website to read an article on the issues surrounding fair trade coffee.\n    \n  \nOne concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States, it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low- wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are likely to fall. \nThere are, however, several reasons to believe that while globalization has helped some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans. \nFirst, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S. trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars from all the major automakers and imported several million cars from other countries.\nMost U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages\u2014and many of them do quite well in the world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a small impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor market is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect of trade on low-wage workers depends considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income workers is small.\nSecond, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports from low-wage countries cannot replace. For example, we cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from countries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the primary determinant of their wages.\nFinally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer due to protectionism in all the industries\u2014even those in which they do not work. For example, food and clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic necessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.\nThe benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the economy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a whole\u2014and thus helped to raise the average level of wages. \nLabor Standards and Working Conditions\nWorkers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid less than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the United States, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child labor or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S. trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have labor standards similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.\nIn thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is truly unacceptable and what is painful to think about. \nMost people, economists included, have little difficulty with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such practices\u2014including shutting out imported products made with such labor. \nMany cases, however, are less clear-cut. An opinion article in the *New York Times* several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: \u201cThis makes much more money and is more comfortable.\u201d\nOther workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar situations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nThere is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to protect employees. According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for new parents, and among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum duration is about two months. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States, vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the United States of using unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports until the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar argument.\nThis is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. However, linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask:\nWhat are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over? \nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["international trade", "opportunity cost", "protectionism", "labour standards", "working conditions", "bumper sticker", "north american free trade agreement", "mexico", "us", "trade", "highwage workers", "united states", "labour market", "comparative advantage", "toys", "labor standards", "lowincome countries", "world labor", "united states", "minimum wage", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "20-03": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of restricting imports, including the infant industry argument, the anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the unsafe consumer products argument, and the national interest argument\n- Explain dumping and race to the bottom\n- Evaluate the significance of countries' perceptions on the benefits of growing trade\nAs we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic gains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale. With these overall costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support restricting imports.\nThe Infant Industry Argument\nImagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians, business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills, management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit Macroeconomic Policy Around the World for more information on the infant industry argument.)\nThe infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy industry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to senility and obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.\nAs one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of computer products for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers. However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and performance by three to five years\u2014a long time in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil's computer industry never competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.\nProtectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has provided little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries.  \nHowever, several countries in East Asia offer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a package of indirect and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign competition and government loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example, subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and running.\nWhy did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? \nAn early 1990 World Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:\n1. Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where your country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.\n2. Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on having the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on many other industries.\n3. Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.\nIn Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in global markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government could phase out protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the government could phase out protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.\nFollowing these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will receive the benefits of treatment as \u201cinfants\u201d and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies. Also, if the country's government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few key industries, it has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions, and government support of research and development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is not the only or even the best way to support key industries.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website to view a presentation by Pankaj Ghemawat questioning how integrated the world really is.\n    \n  \nThe Anti-Dumping Argument\nDumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production.  \nAnti-dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production.  \nSince dumping is not allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO.\nAnti-dumping complaints have risen in recent years, from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s. Note that dumping cases are countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings go down. Individual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government has dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2009, for example, some U.S. imports that were under anti-dumping orders included pasta from Turkey, steel pipe fittings from Thailand, pressure-sensitive plastic tape from Italy, preserved mushrooms and lined paper products from India, and cut-to-length carbon steel and non-frozen apple juice concentrate from China.\nWhy Might Dumping Occur?\nWhy would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production\u2014which presumably means taking a loss? \nThis question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.\nThe innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps demand for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to low levels\u2014even below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example, it may sell goods at below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of production\u2014this may be the market in action.\nThe sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S. competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing. \nShould Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?\nAnti-dumping cases pose two questions: \nHow much sense do they make in economic theory? \nHow much sense do they make in economic theory? \nIn terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and supply, the government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are difficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing hard against each other and providing low prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms exporting to the United States.\nEven if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short term, and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping investigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged with calculating the appropriate \u201ccost of production,\u201d which can be as much an art as a science.\nFor example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it count part of the factory's cost in this year's cost of production? When a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like China for example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly enough, government regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern has arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-dumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.\nIn the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost all the anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping cases has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping laws.\nThe Environmental Protection Argument\nThe potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: \n\u201cThe consequences of globalization for the environment are not good. \u2026 Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy enough of the planet's basic biological and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically compromised.\u201d \nIf free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism\nIn general, high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and low-income countries like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such as sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks, and national parks to protect wildlife.\nThis gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome possibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d scenario and the question of how quickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.\nThe Race to the Bottom Scenario\nThe race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation describes a situation in which profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. \nFaced with such behavior, countries reduce their environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all, provide jobs and economic cloud. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in countries where firms can pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d\nAlthough the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker environmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they look at many different factors: the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation, communications, and electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the local government. The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are no more than 1 to 2% of the costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors that determine location are much more important to these companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.\nWhen an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental laws, it typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter environmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales\u2014by building up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned plants in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do locally-owned plants.\nPressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards\nIn some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce their environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure these countries into adopting stronger standards. \nFor example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income countries, along with stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping to reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African countries.\nHowever, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to dictate to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or how they should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options other than the threat of protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help pay for and carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income countries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the environment.\nAfter all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income countries\u2014agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like \u201cthis tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe\u201d or \u201cthis product made only with wood not taken from rainforests,\u201d so that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also reinforces these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming, the preservation of biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries that share a national border or are within a region often sign environmental agreements about air and water rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.\nFinally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more strict environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other high-income countries. Many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries than the United States.\nThe Unsafe Consumer Products Argument\nOne argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. \nConsumer rights groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their health and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the subject: \u201cIt allows countries to set their own standards.\u201d It also says that regulations must be based on science, and they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.\nAs an example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States to pass laws requiring that all food products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards approved by the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards. However, such standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety standards for domestically produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or one set of standards for imports from Europe and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.\nIn 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead in the paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. More recently, in 2013, Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.\nThe National Interest Argument\nSome argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products, such as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. \nOn closer consideration, this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.\nAs an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all energy, and 25% of the oil used in the United States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East have shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt across the United States economy. These disruptions threaten a possible cutoff of foreign oil that would be detrimental to the U.S. economy and U.S. consumers.\nThis is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports. If the United States needs to be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an emergency, as the United States government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no sense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the United States should shut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil production is increasing. Shale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques. \nWhether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to national security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons builders are not confident that they can continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use this key product, or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech components or materials to last through an armed conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc, although many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent years.\nThink every country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.\nClear It Up\nHow does the United States really feel about expanding trade?\nHow do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade ties between countries. Table 20.3 shows the percentages who answered either \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good\u201d for some of countries surveyed.\nFor those who think of the United States as the world's leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may be perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between countries is \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good,\u201d Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.\n    \n        Country\n        Very Good\n        Somewhat Good\n        Total\n    \n    \n        China\n        38%\n        53%\n        91%\n    \n    \n        South Africa\n        42%\n        43%\n        87%\n    \n    \n        South Korea\n        24%\n        62%\n        86%\n    \n    \n        Germany\n        30%\n        55%\n        85%\n    \n    \n        Canada\n        29%\n        53%\n        82%\n    \n    \n        United Kingdom\n        28%\n        50%\n        78%\n    \n    \n        Mexico\n        22%\n        55%\n        77%\n    \n    \n        Brazil\n        13%\n        59%\n        72%\n    \n    \n        Japan\n        17%\n        55%\n        72%\n    \n    \n        United States\n        14%\n        45%\n        59%\n    \nTable 20.3 The Status of Growing Trade Ties between Countries (Source: http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/258.pdf)\nOne final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that lobbyists and politicians can tout almost any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be \u201cstrategic materials\u201d and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although the government removed wool from the official list of \u201cstrategic\u201d materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for almost 40 years until the government repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. \nAll too often, the national interest argument has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to certain industries or companies. After all, politicians, not nonpartisan analysts make decisions about what constitutes a key strategic material.\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["dumping", "environmental protection argument", "unsafe consumer products argument", "national interest argument", "infant industry argument", "brazil", "computer industry", "foreign competition", "domestic industry", "antidumping argument", "tariffs", "cost of production", "world trade organization", "euro", "dumping", "foreign firms", "cost of production", "local store", "goingoutof", "antidumping cases", "economic theory", "foreign producers", "domestic industry", "global trade", "environment", "sierra club", "environmental lobbying organization", "high", "race to the bottom scenario", "global environmental degradation", "profitseeking multinational companies", "weak standards", "lowincome countries", "globalization", "international trade", "elephants", "domestic policies", "environmental goals", "consumer rights groups", "world trade organization", "safety standards", "us wheat", "national interest argument", "national security applications", "united states", "domestic oil production", "upi", "united states", "expanding trade", "nations", "survey results", "growing trade", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "20-04": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Explain the origin and role of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\n- Discuss the significance and provide examples of regional trading agreements\n- Analyze trade policy at the national level\n- Evaluate long-term trends in barriers to trade\nPublic policy arguments about how nations should react to globalization and trade are fought out at several levels: at the global level through the World Trade Organization and through regional trade agreements between pairs or groups of countries.\nLearn with Videos\nThe World Trade Organization\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the years after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues raised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. \nThe third planned organization was to be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.\nThe GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start negotiating the next agreement. Table 22.4 shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO. Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.\nYear\nPlace or Name of Round\nMain Subjects\nNumber of Countries Involved\n1947\nGeneva\nTariff reduction\n23\n1949\nAnnecy\nTariff reduction\n13\n1951\nTorquay\nTariff reduction\n38\n1956\nGeneva\nTariff reduction\n26\n1960\u201361\nDillon round\nTariff reduction \n26\n1964\u201367\nKennedy round\nTariffs, anti-dumping measures\n62\n1973\u201379\nTokyo round\nTariffs, nontariff barriers\n102\n1986\u201394\nUruguay round\nTariffs, nontariff barriers, services, intellectual property, dispute settlement, textiles, agriculture, creation of WTO\n123\n2001\u2013\nDoha round\nAgriculture, services, intellectual property, competition, investment, environment, dispute settlement\n147\nTable 22.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization\nThe sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman\u2019s Agreement to Talk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain industries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in every case.\nLike the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government with power to impose its decisions on others. The total staff  of the WTO in 2014 was 640 people and its annual budget was $197 million, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities.\n  \n  \n     \n    Visit this website for a list of some benefits of trade.\n    \n  \nRegional Trading Agreements\nThere are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging from free trade agreements, in which participants allow each other's imports without tariffs or quotas, to common markets, in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to full economic unions, in which, in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements.\nThe best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War II, leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association, evolved into a common market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the European Union. \nThe EU, as it is often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of money like the German mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own currency. Another key element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across Europe.\nFor the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from Caribbean countries, and a free trade agreement with Israel.\nThe world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now in place. Table 22.5 lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just agreements to continue talking, while others set specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described the current trade treaties as a \u201cspaghetti bowl,\u201d which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries with trade treaties looks like.\nThere is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise free trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from anywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of the World Trade Organization.\nTrade Agreements\nParticipating Countries \nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\nAustralia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, People\u2019s Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States, Vietnam\nEuropean Union (EU)\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom*\nNorth America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nCanada, Mexico, United States\nLatin American Integration Association (LAIA)\nArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nBrunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\nAngola, Botswana, Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe\nTable 22.5 Some Regional Trade Agreements\nLearn with Videos\nTrade Policy at the National Level\nYet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and regional trade agreements, happens at the national level. The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such imports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the United States Department of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from other countries. The United States International Trade Commission\u2014a government agency\u2014determines whether the dumping has substantially injured domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.\nIn the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or negotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously negotiating to reduce trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements offer a method for countries to restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: \u201cSure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement just won't let me.\u201d\n  \n  \n     \n    If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because it is easier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group that has diffuse interests (consumers). \n    \n    This is a question about trade policy theory. Visit this website and read the article by Jonathan Rauch.\n    \n  \nLong-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade\nIn newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and acrimony. Countries are almost constantly threatening to challenge other nations' \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements. Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will \u201cestablish a fair playing field\u201d or \u201cprevent unfair trade\u201d\u2014although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international trade.\nThrough all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990, after decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern: After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the century. Although measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they generally appear to be at lower levels than they had been previously, too.\nThus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have made international trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information management. The result has been the powerful surge of international trade.\nLearn with Videos\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["world trade organization", "general agreement on tariffs and trade", "regional trading agreements", "trade policy", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "world trade organization", "gatt", "nontariff barriers", "intellectual property", "textiles", "regional trading agreements", "economic integration", "free trade agreements", "euro", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "trade policy", "regional trade agreements", "usa", "import quotas", "domestic sugar producers", "united", "longterm trends", "barriers to trade", "newspaper headlines", "trade policy", "learning", "feedback", "market overview", "survey", "survey", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}, "20-05": {"text": "Overview\n  \n    By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n  \n- Asses the complexity of international trade\n- Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade\n- Explain disruptive market change\nEconomists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. \nOver time, the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker with greater productivity and higher wages from specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices.\nThe average person, however, is hypothetical, not real\u2014representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate. Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national economy are also all legitimate issues.\nThe common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with the costs and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs. \nTo gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called Technotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers\u2014and some of the competing firms will even go bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? \nMost people who live in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would argue for government support of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills. Government might also support research and development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. \nBlocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.\nNow, imagine that Technotron's new \u201ctechnology\u201d is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from another country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective situation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron's new technology\u2014which in this case is importing goods from another county\u2014other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade.\nSome workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented economy, some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons. Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more or less productive. Tough domestic competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings of a market economy.\nIn other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not argue that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs \nIndeed, the story of Technotron begins with a disruptive market change\u2014a new technology\u2014that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the specific issues resulting from these disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur.\nPlease your write summary below", "keyphrases": ["international trade", "marketoriented economy", "technological technology", "us", "call centre", "collaborative browsing", "customer service representative", "web site"]}}
