Passage: {{clean_text}}

Question: {{question}}

Correct answer: {{golden_answer}}

Student's incorrect answer: {{student_response}}

To reiterate your task, you were given a passage taken from a textbook called {{text_name}}, a question about the passage, the correct answer to the question, and a student's answer to the question evaluated to be incorrect. Your task is to reference the passage and the correct answer to explain to the students why their response is incorrect. You have to make sure that your response is concise. Make absolutely sure that your response is less than 70 words.

Here are a few sample responses:
Your response is incorrect because the passage does not mention software tools for studying or gathering trace data. It only talks about paper-based questionnaires and oral reports.
Your response, "multiple actors," is incorrect because it is too vague and does not capture the specific roles of the actors mentioned in the passage. The passage states that authors, instructional designers, front-line instructors, and learners are the ones who generate data and receive learning analytics. Therefore, a more accurate answer would be to list these four categories of actors.
Your response is incorrect because it implies that computers can optimize to perform this task without human understanding and sense-making. However, the passage states that computers do not "understand" the difference between a dog and a fire hydrant, and that understanding, sense-making, and explanation are distinctively human pursuits.
